California's coast is dotted with bar-built estuaries.  


\emph{Similar type of estuary exists on wave dominated coasts in Mediterranean climates worldwide. The terminology intermittently closed and open lakes and lagoons (ICOLL) is used in Australia, while the South African's refer to their intermittently closed estuaries as temporarily open/closed estuaries (TOCE).  Here we will refer to intermittently closed or open estuaries, but recognize that this naming convention... }

\section{Hydrodynamics of intermittently closed estauaries}
Previous work has described general functioning of intermittently closed estuaries.  
\emph{description of lots of things}


\emph{lack of work in california, not a lot of interest since some work in the 1990s.  Recently beginning to connect hydrodynamics to nearshore environment \parencite{dodet_wave-current_2013, uncles_infragravity_2014}.}



Research Questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{How does the Pescadero estuary function during open, closed, and transitioning mouth states?}
	\item{What are the drivers of hydrodynamics in the open state of small intermittently closed bar-built estuaries?}
	\item{How do tides, stratification, infragravity motion forcing, and \emph{marshes} set salt dispersion in a strongly stratified bar-built estuary?}
	\item{How did the 2011 Tohoku tsunami alter flow in California's bar built estuaries?}
\end{itemize}
