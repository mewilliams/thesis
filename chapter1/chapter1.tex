Research Questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{How does the Pescadero estuary function during open, closed, and transitioning mouth states?}
	\item{What are the drivers of hydrodynamics in the open state of small intermittently closed bar-built estuaries?}
	\item{How do tides, stratification, infragravity motion forcing, and \emph{marshes} set salt dispersion in a strongly stratified bar-built estuary?}
	\item{How did the 2011 Tohoku tsunami alter flow in California's bar built estuaries?}
\end{itemize}
