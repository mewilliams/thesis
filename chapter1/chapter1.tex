The land-sea interface is one of the most biologically productive regions on the planet, while being heavily populated. Along the world's coastlines, rivers and streams drain XXXXX watersheds through X\# estuaries.  These estuaries are in many cases nursery environments XXX, but also with large population centers areound often natural harbor XXX, and with international shipping, and ETC, estuaries are also polluted and invaded by \emph{invasive species}. 

Physics of estuaries is \emph{interesting} because where salty ocean water and fresh river water meet, density differences XXXXX. Add to that XXXXX forcing by tidal flow, changing riverine discharge, wind forcing, and in large estuaries the effect of Earth's rotation, and the understanding of estuarine physics is a complicated affair. Characterizing conditions for \emph{bion00b thing}, understanding contaminant transport, ETC, motivates the XXXX study of these environments. 

Within the state of California on North America's west coast, the San Francisco Bay drains the Sacramento-San Joaquin watershed, accounting for X acres in CA, \emph{OR, NV?}. The Colorado River XXXXXXXX. The rest of the state's X acres are drained through rivers and streams in the California Coastal Range \emph{X mountain ranges spread from X to X}. These waterways meet the ocean through California's X bar-built estuaries \emph{(and X coastal inlets).}

Bar-built estuaries are geomorphically defined as XXXXX. In California, these estuaries are small and have an intermittent connection to the ocean. The sandy inlet of these estuaries may close for days, seasonally, or may only temporarily open with large flood events. 

Similar estuaries exist worldwide. California's estuaires may be most similar to those in South Africa () or Australia (), but estuaries with temporarily closed inlets exist in Chile \parencite{dussaillant_water_2009}, Brazil (), Spain (), Portugal (), India (), \emph{Hawaii?()},... and some processes .... in these estuaries may also be found/relevant to small bar-built estuaries that do not experience inlet closure. 

Despite their prevalence, a well established understanding of estuarine physics for intermittently closed estuaries does not exist. Many studies focus on the morphodynamics of inlet condisions/changes (e.g. ...), though .... mouth closure is still elusive. Some work has focused on hydrodynamic conditions (e.g. ...), but XXXXX. A brief description of our current understanding follows.

\section{Morphodynamics, sand transport, inlet closure, accretion, opening}
Davidson et al. \cite{davidson_simple_2009} \emph{says that} sediment infilling in intermittently closed inlets is due to three processes: litoral processes, tidal inlet flow asymmetries, and downslope sediment diffusion.

Missing from this work is (a) much of anything in California, (b) short timescales, (c) thinking about estuarine physics in the context of that field which has been defined for larger systems (e.g. dispersion)... in these.. This dissertation aims to begin to fill in some of these holes.

Observations in the Pescadero estuary in Northern California took place in several field campaigns over 2010 - 2012, and included open state, closed state, and transitional XXXX conditions. The Pescadero estuary is interesting/important because XXXXX, and one of the goals of this project was to characterize the Pescadero estuary to inform management decisions there.

\emph{Similar type of estuary exists on wave dominated coasts in Mediterranean climates worldwide.

\section{Hydrodynamics of intermittently closed estauaries}
Previous work has described general functioning of intermittently closed estuaries.

These estuaries exist in many parts of the world, but are restricted to Mediterranean climates on wave-dominated coasts \emph{perhaps a citation}, \emph{which is basically} Spain, Portugal, South Africa, (W?) Australia, \emph{maybe Chile?}. 

Previously studied intermittently open estuaries include those in South Africa (e.g. \cite{largier_dynamics_1991})...


Interest in the hydrodynamics and morphoodynamic of California's bar-built estuaries is \emph{on the up swing}. Older studies include the work of Elwany et al. where X \cite{elwany_opening_1998}. More recent work looking at mouth dynamics on the Russian River estuary \parencite{behrens_characterization_2009, behrens_episodic_2013} and on the mouth of the Carmel River estuary \parencite{rich_hydrologic_2013}... On the hydrodynamics side of things, Cousins et al. \cite{cousins_hydrodynamics_2011} did X in Rodeo Lagoon. 



\emph{lack of work in california, not a lot of interest since some work in the 1990s.  Recently beginning to connect hydrodynamics to nearshore environment \parencite{dodet_wave-current_2013, uncles_infragravity_2014}.}



Research Questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{How does the Pescadero estuary function during open, closed, and transitioning mouth states?}
	\item{What are the drivers of hydrodynamics in the open state of small intermittently closed bar-built estuaries?}
	\item{How do tides, stratification, infragravity motion forcing, and \emph{marshes} set salt dispersion in a strongly stratified bar-built estuary?}
	\item{How did the 2011 Tohok$\overline{\mathrm{u}}$ tsunami alter flow in Calfifornia's bar built estuaries?}
\end{itemize}




\section{outline of this thesis}

In this dissertation, I will present XXXXX.

Chapter 2 focuses on work specific to the Pescadero estuary. In this chapter, field methods relevant to the work in general are presented, and the conditions affecting dynamics in the system in general are described. These are followed by a description of closed state hydrodynamics and a look at how the Pescadero estuary responds to the opening of the closed mouth. This chapter aims to provide insight to land managers through descriptive XXXXXX of the Pescadero estuary.

In Chapter 3, I examine open-state forcing and hydrodynamics. The connection between waves and nearshore sand transport has long been established, bu tthe nearshore influence on dynamics within bar-built estuaries is XXXXX. \emph{(Sentence on constricted mouth).} This chapter attempts to describe the influence of the nearshore environment unique to bar-built estuaries... \emph{and... soemthing else}. 

Chapters 3 and 4 address salt transprot in the open state, first as XXX in Chapter 3, and then as XXXX in Chapter 4. 

Finally, Chapter 5 describes the response of the Pescadero estuary to the arrival of waves from the tsunami generated by the 2011 Tohok$\overline{\mathrm{u}}$ earthquake.
