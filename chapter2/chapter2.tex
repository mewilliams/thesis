\chapter{The Pescadero estuary} \label{chPescadero}

The Pescadero estuary is located at the confluence of Pescadero Creek and Butano Creek in southern San Mateo County on the California coast (Figure~\ref{fig:ccrp_2010}). The estuary drains a watershed of 210 km\textsuperscript{2} of the Santa Cruz mountains, located in California's coastal range. The coastal range has a rainfall dominated hydrology, and freshwater stream flow on the creeks is flashy and seasonal.

A history of the Pescadero marsh was compiled as
the M.A. dissertation work of (CITE Viollis 1979). The marsh used to be bigger, has a history of being farmed, drained, duck hunting ground... biggest changes in the 20\textsuperscript{th} century (as written in
1979) because of construction of levees and roads, logging, increased
agriculture in the watershed as well as increased water use. The marsh underwent further alterations in the 1990s when the Highway 1 bridge was replaced and \emph{culverts were installed between the Pescadero creek and channel to the North Pond in an attempt to create habitat for X SPECIES... Can be read about in ESA document?}.

California's intermittently closed estuaries have been seen to play an important role in the lifecycle of juvenile salmonids (Cite Sean Hayes). Unfortunately, massive fish mortality has been observed with the opening of the mouth of the estuary in late fall in many of the past X years. This problem has led to scientific study (cite SJSU theses) as well as lawsuits (cite WSJ article), but to date a conclusive explanation for the triggers of fish mortality has not been defined. 

Work to understand hydrodynamic and salt transport processes in intermittently closed estuaries in general and in the Pescadero estuary in specific aims to develop a framework for understanding these understudied systems.

\section{Measurements made in the Pescadero estuary} \label{measurementslabel}

Measurements were made over the course of three years to quantify dominant forcing during the open and closed states of the estuary. A description of measurement methods precedes a description of general observations and functioning of this estuary.

Field measurements were taken in the Pescadero estuary during four field deployments:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item March - May 2010 
	\item September 2010 
	\item November 2010 - May or June 2011 
	\item August 2011 - June 5, 2012
\end{enumerate}

 Measurements were not always continuous because instrument batteries sometimes died before being replaced and instruments were sometimes buried, failed, or damaged during the deployment. Later deployments utilized more instruments and so had better resolution in space.  The frequency of measurements was also increased in later deployments. 

\subsubsection{Bathymetry} \label{sssec:bathymetry}
Bathymetry measurements were made using the bottom track feature of an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP; RDI Workhorse Monitor 1200kHz) pulled on a raft behind a canoe on [X] November, 3020. The bathymetry map (Figure \emph{copy from chapter 3}) shows that the lower embayment of the estuary is shallow and becomes deep in the narrow channel upstream of the lagoonal area and downstream of the confluence of the Pescadero and Butano Creeks. The mouth was not because measurements were made in the closed-mouth state and because the geometry of the mouth is constantly changing. Bedrock sits below the mouth, setting a minimum elevation for the mouth, but the bedrock is usually covered with sand. 

Sensors were located according to bathymetry. Early attempts to collect measurements in the inlet resulted in buried and broken instruments, even after 24-hour deployments, so long term measurements were limited to the parts of the estuary with less rapid sand transport. 

\subsubsection{Depth} \label{sssec:depth}
Depth measurements were made using the pressure transducer on conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD) sensors
attached to milk crates (RBR XR-420 CTD). The pressure values on the instruments were adjusted to
changing atmospheric pressure using air pressure measurements from the
Half Moon Bay airport (KHAF). An approximate density of $\rho$ = 1021 kg
m\textsuperscript{-3} is used with the hydrostatic pressure equation ${p
= \rho g h}$, slightly overestimating the depth when the estuary is
fresh and density is lower than this value. Error in the pressure
measurement using this assumption may be up to 2.5\%. Further error is
introduced comparing pressure measurements in a quiescent water column
to a quickly moving flow. Stagnation pressure p is actually p = 0.5
$\rho$ g h +  v\textsuperscript{2} (cite general fluid mechanics
textbook). Under quiescent flow, pressure values measured are
hydrostatic pressure. Under small velocities, error in this assumption
is small. If flow reaches 1 m s\textsuperscript{-1} in a 1 m water
column, the pressure reading will increase by 5\% therefore depth
calculated from these measurements not accounting for dynamic pressure
will be slightly overestimated.

We observe error in comparison of recorded water level (according to the
staff gauge on the highway 1 bridge) while the estuary is draining in
February and March 2012 and expect this error to be due to dynamic
pressure readings. Thus, to set the water level in the estuary to a
NAVD88 or MLLW datum, we use measurements taken during the closed water
state and assume quiescent flow.  Further error is introduced as
moorings were weighted to the ground but not fastened in place and some
movement of the bed or mooring may have occurred. \emph{The staff gauge on the Highway 1 bridge is X ft above X ft NAVD 88, and that translates to X ft MLLW or X m MLLW.}

\subsubsection{Salinity and Temperature} \label{sssec:SandT}
Salinity and temperature were also measured by moored CTDs. The instruments were attached to weighted milk crates, floating lines, and floating buoys. In some cases, subsurface buoys maintained taught lines.  Shorter, taught lines seemed to be more prone to being dragged away from their original location so later deployments allowed sensors to be more free floating. \emph{INSERT IMAGE OF CTD MOORING.}

\subsubsection{Velocity} \label{sssec:velmeas}
Velocity measurements were made with moored ADCPs as well as with moored acoustic Doppler velocimeters (ADV; Nortek Vector). ADCPs were attached to flat plates and placed on the bed of the estuary. The ADCPs used are typically used in deeper flow, and were not always successful in measuring velocities. The ADVs, usually attached downward facing from a sawhorse frame, were able to measure velocity, but instruments fixed near the mouth were susceptible to damage by floating debris. In one instance, the titanium probe of an ADV was bent after being deployed only eight hours, probably by a car wheel found the next day in the intertidal zone floating on quickly moving infragravity bores. Driftwood logs are also ubiquitous along the shores of the Pescadero estuary.  \emph{INSERT IMAGES OF ADCP AND ADV MOORINGS.}


\subsubsection{Wind measurements} \label{sssec:windmeas}
Wind measurements were made using a \emph{[Campbell Scientific Met Station]} during only the Fall 2011 - Spring 2012 field deployment. The wind vane was mounted approximately 3 m above the water level in the marsh adjacent to the estuary \emph{(See location on a figure, and include a photograph?)}.  Measurements show that wind direction through the marsh is almost entirely bi-directional (Figures~\ref{fig:metstn_pdo_ws_wdir} and~\ref{fig:metstn_pdo_windrose}). Wind direction of between 300 and 360 degrees is blowing from the ocean and wind blowing from 100 to 170 degrees is land-sourced wind. This constrained directionality is attributed to topography of the marsh.  The inlet is protected by bluffs to the south and historical sand dunes reinforced for the Highway 1 bridge to the north. The marsh itself is located in a low valley, further constricting wind flow paths. 

Windspeeds from the ocean are higher than those from the land (Figures~\ref{fig:metstn_pdo_ws_wdir} and~
\ref{fig:metstn_pdo_windrose}).

The years 2010-2012 encompassed \emph{[? El ninho, la ninha, drought].} Freshwater flow in water year 2010 (1 October, 2009 to 30 September, 2010) was above the 61 year median, and flow in water year 2012 was below the 61 year median. \emph{Do wave conditions change with ENSO, PDO?

\subsubsection{Freshwater}
Freshwater streamflow into the Pescadero estuary is estimated based on a United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauge located on Pescadero Creek 8.5 km upstream from the mouth of the estuary (USGS 11162500). The gauge is downstream of 57 \% of the watershed, so to estimate freshwater flow into the estuary the gauged discharge measurement is multiplied by $Q_R = 1.76Q_{R,G}$. Unaccounted for freshwater diversions are thought to exist downstream of
the gauge which likely reduce freshwater flow into the estuary, however we do not have a way to quantify these diversions and thus will report freshwater flow as if they do not exist. Flow into the Pescadero estuary was highest in the early part of the calendar year. \emph{Flows as high as X m\textsuperscript{3} s\textsuperscript{-1} and as low as X m\textsuperscript{3} s\textsuperscript{-1} were observed during the years of our field deployments (Figure~\ref{fig:QTH_2010_2012}a).} 

The Mediterranean climate of California is highlighted by seasonal precipitation. Freshwater flow in the rainfall-dominated Pescadero Creek watershed follows this trend. Figure~\ref{fig:Q_1951_2012} shows median gauged creek flow at the USGS Pescadero gauge including data from 1951 to 2012 as well as the freshwater discharge curves for the water years of our study.

\subsubsection{Tides}
The nearest ocean tide gauges to the Pescadero estuary are operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at Crissy Field in San Francisco, California (Station 9414290) as well as in Monterey Harbor in Monterey, California (Station 9413450). Water level in both locations are recorded every six minutes, and one minute tsunami-capable unverified data is also recorded at these stations. The Northern Californian coast experiences a semidiurnal tide with a neap tide range of under 1 m and a spring tide range up to \emph{almost} 3 m (Figure~\ref{fig:QTH_2010_2012}b). 

\subsubsection{Ocean wave climate}
Ocean wave conditions are obtained through NOAA National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). NDBC buoy 46012 is located approximately 40 km WNW of the Pescadero estuary at 208.8 m depth. This buoy reports ocean significant wave height every hour. Deep water wave heights are larger than wave heights experienced at the coast, but larger waves 40 km from shore will result in larger waves at the coast so we use this value as a proxy for coastal ocean conditions. Maximum wave heights in the ocean from 2010 - 2012 were over 7 m, and minimum were under 1 m (Figure~\ref{fig:QTH_2010_2012}c). Ocean wave heights also follow a seasonal trend with typically smaller waves in the summer months transitioning to larger wave climates in the fall, winter and spring months when storms on the Pacific Ocean generate large swell.

\subsubsection{Wind}
Wind conditions are approximated by measurements at the Half Moon Bay airport (KHAF) during periods before the wind vane was installed in the Pescadero estuary.  There is good agreement in [Wind Speed? Direction], as shown in [FIGURE].

\subsubsection{Tsunami}
The 2011 Tohoku earthquake generated a Pacific Ocean-wide tsunami. A description of the ocean state and the response of the Pescadero estuary to the forcing of the small amplitude tsunami that reached California is found in Chapter~\ref{chTsunami}.

\section{Two main states: open and closed, plus some intermediate stuff}
\label{betterlabelmaybe}

Two main states exist for the Pescadero estuary: open and closed.  The inlet continuously expands and contracts with nearshore sand transport competing with freshwater and ebb tidal scour. \emph{Open} is characterized by any period in which the estuarine water level falls with the outgoing tide, and a \emph{closed} state is highlighted by the lack of outflowing water thus no falling depth. Within the open state, tides in the estuary may be an attenuated version of the ocean tides \emph{[Figure]}, and this state we will consider to be fully open. An extensive description of relevant hydrodynamic and salt transport processes in the fully open state is found in Chapter 3 and 4. \emph{Some words later on interannual variability to open state? How much freshwater it takes to freshen the estuary?}.

% ---------------------- figure end ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%------------------------

Because the estuarine inlet is in a constantly unstable condition, an intermediate state between fully open and closed is also common in the Pescadero estuary.  In this state, the sandy inlet is constricted. Here, the estuarine water level rises and falls in response to ocean tides, but may only fill with the diurnal high high tide \emph{[Figure]} or be severely attenuated \emph{[Figure]}. We consider this condition to be a highly-constricted open state. Realistically, the open state of the estuary is a continuum. Sand moves in and out of the inlet with tidal flow and waves. High freshwater discharge will scour the mouth.

The closed state of the estuary is characterized by tidal depth oscillations being shut off. This does not mean that the ocean tides cease to influence water level in the estuary but that the water is not outflowing through the channel. Variation in forcing within the closed
state depends on length of closure, to be discussed in section~\ref{ssec:ClosedDynamics}.

Some discussion of mouth closure in the Pescadero estuary following the 2011 Tohoku tsunami is found in chapter~\ref{chTsunami}, but the subject is largely untreated here. Work in the Russian River \emph{(Cite Behrens phd, Behrens et al 2013)} as well as in the Carmel Lagoon \emph{(cite Rich and Keller, 201?)}, both California estuaries, discuss processes for mouth closure relevant to the Pescadero estuary. The specific north facing geometry of the mouth of the Pescadero inlet may affect the direction from which waves must arrive to cause nearshore sand transport to close the mouth in comparison to other California estuaries, but this is a topic for further research.

The transition from the closed state to open state in the Pescadero estuary naturally occurs only when increased freshwater streamflow overtops the sand bar at the mouth. It has been suggested in other estuaries that storm waves overtopping the bar may breach the estuary from the ocean side [CITE], but the mouth of the Pescadero estuary is
somewhat protected by the southern end cliff, and wave conditions observed during our years of study make this unlikely. Given a storm surge similar to that carried by Superstorm Sandy which created new inlets in Barnegat Bay [CITE], this could be possible, but these are very unlikely to occur in California's climate.

A description of estuarine dynamics during the closed and transitioning states follows in this chapter, with the description of dynamics in the open state to follow in the proceeding chapters.

	\end{center}
\label{fig:beachriver_after} \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Closed estuarine water levels} \label{cl_wl}

Immediately after closure, the mouth of the Pescadero estuary is still low in elevation (Figure~\ref{fig:mouth_fb_20110825}). Throughout the closed period, we expect the height of the sand berm to be equal to or slightly above the height of the estuary water surface.Initial lagoon infilling occurs primarily to ocean water overtopping the low sand berm. Figure~\ref{fig:depthclosuref11} shows the estuarine water level and ocean water level for the nine days following the mouth closure on August 23, 2011.  

There are at least two mechanisms by which ocean water enters the Pescadero estuary during the closed mouth state. (1) Waves overtop the sand berm directly into the estuary. (2) Waves overtop the crest of the steep bermed beach, and gravity causes salt water to flow down the beach and into the estuary in a river of sea water (Figure~\ref{fig:beach_andmouth_20110831_beachriver}. The second mechanism is less frequent, but more dramatic, with the one event observed corresponding with a \emph{(X cm)} rapid increase in lagoon water level on that day (Figure~\ref{fig:depthclosuref11}).

Wave overwash carries salt water into the estuary and grows the sand berm. A study on the Belongil Beach and Belongil Creek inlet in New South Wales, Australia showed that \emph{XXXX} [Baldock et al., 2008]. Our observations suggest that wave overtopping in the Pescadero 
estuary occurs on an infragravity timescale, consistent with forcing seen in the open state of the estuary \emph{(cf chapter~\ref{ch3})}.

Due to the hypsometry of the marsh, initial wave overwash is most relevant to raising the water level in the closed lagoon. After a certain point, the surface of the lagoon begins to spill across the marsh and at this point filling becomes much more gradual. Because nearshore forcing is primarily responsible for sand transport causing accretion of the sand berm at the mouth of the estuary, it is unlikely that a condition exists where the mouth becomes high enough that ocean water cannot enter. \emph{[Sand transport by wind may also shape the mouth... I read once]}

\subsubsection{Closed estuary density structure} \label{cl_strat}

In the closed state, the water column remains stratified (Figures X and X and X). The density is set primarily by salinity of the water column, and a fresh or well-mixed brackish state was never present in our closed-state measurements. 

STRATIFICATION: SALT * Evolution of stratification (saltier, freshwater surface layer). * Wedderburn number. The Wedderburn number is a nondimensional number used to compare wind stress (?) to stratification and is an indicator of [what it would take to mix a stratified water column]. The number is a comparison of [quick derivation here].


* Maybe a potential density anomaly?


* Mixing events: The high Wedderburn number means that the freshwater sitting on the surface of the estuary acts to protect salt-stratified lower water from mixing due to wind stress induced shear... Occasionally
the wind blows (hard enough and/or long enough) to upwell the pycnocline. [Figures - wind, salt]. If this occurs, the wind stress can act directly on the pycnocline. [Descriptions of the figures here].  THis appears to be the primary mechanism of significant mixing during the closed state.  [February 13, 2012].



Hypothesize on mixing of intruding salt. Some parameterization?

TEMPERATURE. (Important to fish). Stratification in the Pescadero
estuary is always dependent on salt. [Because equation of state]. Observations show that after the estuary has closed and a freshwater layer is present, water temperature in the mixed surface
waters follow a diurnal trend of warming and cooling in accordance with
solar heating. The salt-stratified lower layer of the estuary does not
'feel' this diurnal heating, and in fact is much warmer than the surface
water. [Figure: temperature during closed state].




\subsubsection{Closed estuary velocity description} \label{cl_vel}
VELOCITY While the estuary is open to tidal influence, tides are the
main driver of flow (in the absence of very large freshwater discharge).
After the inlet closes, tidal forcing is cut off. Velocity measurements
show that: {What do velocity measurements show?}

%-------------------------------------------------------%


An observed example of wind setup and mixing occurred just prior to the
sand bar breach on November 24, 2010. In situ velocity and salinity
measurements combined with wind measurements at Half Moon Bay airport
are used to understand this event:

On November 23, wind forcing was seaward, small surface velocities in
the Pescadero estuary were consistent with this forcing, and the water
column was vertically stratified. Three layer flow apparent in this
state may be due to the bathymetry of the estuary where the lower end of
the estuary is very shallow. Wind shear may drive surface flow
downstream, and the lower water column will respond by flowing upstream.
At the sensors, [sentence on trapped lower water].

From this point, the wind direction slowly shifted to become landward,
and on November 23 at (X pm) GMT, the wind picked up to 10 m
s\textsuperscript{-1}. The water column responded immediately to this
increased wind shear with surface flow in line with the wind and the
deeper water column compensating with flow in the other direction.
Three-layer flow may not be seen because the upper estuary is deeper and
the end of the estuary [has a sharp wall instead of a shallow lagoon
thing]. Salinity measurements suggest that the strong wind forcing
caused slight upwelling of saltier water at the DS mooring, and
significant downwelling of fresher water at US as the deeper sensor
there went from measuring [15-20] PSU water to [5] PSU water in [X]
hours.

At [XX:XX] on November 24, the wind falls down to 5 m
s\textsuperscript{-1} and the water column relaxes, as evidence by flow
reversal. The surface mixed layer at the ADCP is shallower as seen by
comparing the depth of highest shear at the setup event several hours
earlier to the relaxation event, as well as by looking at the salinity
sensors. As the relaxation occurs, the [surface mixed layer becomes
thicker], but mid-column sensors end up fresher than prior to the mixing
event.

It is upon this slightly more well-mixed background that the lagoon
mouth breach occurs, and it is difficult to determine an exact moment of
estuarine breaching...

*** Three (?) things drive mixing in this state. The first: direct input
of wind shear at the surface creating shear in the water column.  The
second is shear by interfacial drag mid-column. And a third process may
be movement of the lower water column against the bed creating [... more
shear].

These effects may be parameterized in the following way:



%***********************************************************************

%*************************************************
% BREACH STATE
\subsection{Breach.. } \label{breach_dynamics}
Understanding dynamics of the response of the Pescadero estuary to the breach of the mouth sandbar is pressing because of fish mortality events that often occur in conjunction with the opening. Breach events occurred on the following days within our measurement period:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item November 24, 2010
	\item November 11, 2011
	\item January 20-21(?), 2012
	\item Feburary 20(?), 2012
	\item March 3, 2012
\end{enumerate}

Velocity measurements were made during X, X and X, but were not successful during X breach. 

No measurements on top of marsh and few measurements were made in
creeks upstream of the confluence, so data shows what passes by sensors in the lower estuary. High water
levels allow salt to extend farther upstream than measurements were made.

Based on measurements as the sand berm at the mouth breached, two types
of events occurs: one where the entire (lower) estuary is freshened, and
the second where mixing occurs in the fresh surface layer and the
stratified lower layer, but salt water is retained in the depths of the
estuary. [Could maybe do a HOW MUCH ENERGY TO FLUSH BOTTOM WATERS
estimation].


Salt measurements:
In all measurements made during the closed mouth state of the estuary, salt water was present in the estuary and the water column was stratified. In most (all?) cases, the water column had two or more layers, generally characterizable as salt water and fresh water, but more accurately a stratified lower layer and a fresh upper layer.

\section{Interannual variability} \label{IntannVar}

The largest variability observed year to year was in the timing of mouth closure and opening in the Pescadero estuary. The estuary while open to the ocean in September 2010 was highly marine, while during the same days the following year, the mouth was closed and the character of the water column was completely different. 

Low rainfall in water year 2012 limited the freshwater outflow available to maintain an open mouth, and so the mouth repeatedly closed and opened during Winter 2011-2012 and Spring 2012 in what was a seemingly uncharacteristic way. The drought currently occurring in California as of summer 2014 has allowed the mouth to close earlier and stay closed longer, suggesting perhaps a new status quo. 

\section{Anything else?} \label{backofch2}

\emph{field measurement suggestions? how to answer things i can't
answer?}

Lastly, a few suggestions for future field measurements in the Pescadero or any other small California estuary: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The bed moves, so instruments placed on the bottom may do so as well.
	\item Fast infragravity bores (see chapter~\ref{ch3}) may carry driftwood logs, tires, and other marine debris. These floating projectiles can easily damage instruments or drag moorings.
\end{enumerate}
