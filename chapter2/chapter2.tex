\chapter{The Pescadero estuary} \label{chPescadero}

Background on the estuary

\begin{itemize} \item  big picture things: location, size of stuff \item
other research specific to this estuary \end{itemize}

The Pescadero estuary is located at the confluence of Pescadero Creek
and Butano Creek in southern San Mateo County on the California coast (Figure~\ref{fig:ccrp_2010}).
The estuary drains a watershed of 210 km\textsuperscript{2} of the Santa
Cruz mountains, located in California's coastal range. The coastal range
has a rainfall dominated hydrology, and freshwater streamflow on the
creeks is flashy and seasonal.

A history of the Pescadero marsh was compiled as
the M.A. dissertation work of [Viollis, 1979]. The marsh used to be
bigger, has a history of being farmed, drained, duck hunting ground...
biggest changes in the 20\textsuperscript{th} century (as written in
1979) because of construction of levees and roads, logging, increased
agriculture in the watershed as well as increased water use. The marsh underwent further alterations in the 1990s when the Highway 1 bridge was replaced and \emph{culverts were installed between the Pescadero creek and channel to the North Pond in an attempt to create habitat for X SPECIES... Can be read about in ESA document?}.

California's intermittently closed estuaries have been seen to play an important role in the lifecycle of juvenile salmonids (Cite Sean Hayes). Unfortunately, massive fish mortality has been observed with the opening of the mouth of the estuary in late fall in many of the past X years. This problem has led to scientific study (cite SJSU theses) as well as lawsuids (cite WSJ article), but to date a conclusive explanation for the triggers of fish mortality has not been defined. 

Work to understand hydrodynamic and salt transport processes in intermittently closed estuaries in general and in the Pescadero estuary in specific aims to develop a framework for understanding these understudied systems.

\section{Measurements} \label{measurementslabel}

\emph{Needs site description:}
\begin{itemize}
\item bathymetry \item depth of mouth \item bedrock there \item MLLW to water level
conversion. \end{itemize}

Our observations: (not measuring sand) * measurement setup (lead weight,
milk crates, line, subsurface buoys,...). [PICTURES]. Problems with
early setup. Suggestions for anyone in the future making measurements
there. (Comment on driftwood and car wheels).

Depth measurements were made using the pressure transducer on CTDs
attached to milk crates... The RBR pressure values were then adjusted to
changing atmospheric pressure using air pressure measurements from the
Half Moon Bay airport (KHAF). An approximate density of $\rho$ = 1021 kg
m\textsuperscript{-3} is used with the hydrostatic pressure equation ${p
= \rho g h}$, slightly overestimating the depth when the estuary is
fresh and density is lower than this value. Error in the pressure
measurement using this assumption may be up to 2.5\%. Further error is
introduced comparing pressure measurements in a quiescent water column
to a quickly moving flow. Stagnation pressure p is actually p = 0.5
$\rho$ g h +  v\textsuperscript{2} (cite general fluid mechanics
textbook). Under quiescent flow, pressure values measured are
hydrostatic pressure. Under small velocities, error in this assumption
is small. If flow reaches 1 m s\textsuperscript{-1} in a 1 m water
column, the pressure reading will increase by 5\% therefore depth
calculated from these measurements not accounting for dynamic pressure
will be slightly overestimated.

We observe error in comparison of recorded water level (according to the
staff gauge on the highway 1 bridge) while the estuary is draining in
February and March 2012 and expect this error to be due to dynamic
pressure readings. Thus, to set the water level in the estuary to a
NAVD88 or MLLW datum, we use measurements taken during the closed water
state and assume quiescent flow.  Further error is introduced as
moorings were weighted to the ground but not fastened in place and some
movement of the bed or mooring may have occurred.

Field measurements were taken in the Pescadero estuary during four long-term field
deployments:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item March - May 2010 
	\item September 2010 
	\item November 2010 - May or June 2011 
	\item August 2011 - June 5, 2012
\end{enumerate}

 Measurements were not always continuous because instrument batteries sometimes died before being replaced and 
instruments were sometimes buried, failed, or damaged during the deployment. Later deployments utilized more instruments 
and so had better resolution in space.  The frequency of measurements was also increased
in later deployments. A meteorological station measuring wind speed and direction was
installed in September 2011 and remained in place until June 2012.

Summary of range of conditions in all data collected: Salinity : 0 to
[highest] Temperature: cold to hot Windspeed and direction: usually two
directions, probably because of geometry of marsh. Fast to slow. Water
depth? [Depends on how much I can get set to a datum].


%% Wind measurements paragraph:
%% 
Wind measurements were made using a [Campbell Scientific Met Station
thingy] during the Fall 2011 - Spring 2012 field deployment. The wind
vane was mounted approximately 3 m above the water level in the marsh
adjacent to the estuary (See location on a figure).  Measurements show
that wind direction through the marsh is almost entirely bi-directional
(Figures winddir vs. time and wind rose). Wind direction of [360-ish
degrees] is wind blowing from the ocean and from the other direction
[180ish degrees] is land-sourced wind (is that called land breeze?).
This constrained directionality is attributed to topography of the
marsh.  Landward wind from the ocean is constrained by high topography
on the South end of the estuary and marsh. On the northern end of the
estuary inlet, sand dunes and constraint by the [stuff ] supporting the
Highway 1 bridge further constrains flow, essentially funnelling wind
flow through a tunnel.  In the opposite direction, we hypothesize that
the high topography in the south constrains flow, and since the marsh is
[sorta] located in a valley, [flow is two-directional].

Windspeeds from the ocean are higher than those from the land (Figures~\ref{fig:metstn_pdo_ws_dir} and~
\ref{fig:metstn_pdo_windrose}).

\subsubsection{Freshwater}
Freshwater streamflow into the Pescadero estuary is
estimated based on a United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauge
located on Pescadero Creek [X km] upstream from the mouth of the estuary
(USGS XXXXXXXX). This gauge records water height and calculates
freshwater discharge every [X min]. The gauge is downstream of [X] \% of
the watershed, so to estimate freshwater flow into the estuary the
gauged discharge measurement is multiplied by [X = 1.76, eu acho].
Unaccounted for freshwater diversions are thought to exist downstream of
the gauge which likely reduce freshwater flow into the estuary, however
we do not have a way to quantify these diversions and thus will report
freshwater flow as if they do not exist. Flow into the Pescadero estuary was highest in the early part of the calendar year. Flows as high as X m\textsuperscript{3} s\textsuperscript{-1} and as low as X m\textsuperscript{3} s\textsuperscript{-1} were observed during the years of our field deployments (Figure~\ref{fig:QTH_2010_2012}a).

The Mediterranean climate of California is highlighted by seasonal
precipitation. Freshwater flow in the rainfall-dominated Pescadero Creek watershed follows this trend. Figure~\ref{fig:Q_1951_2012} shows median gauged creek flow at the USGS Pescadero gauge including data from 1951 to 2012 as well as the freshwater discharge curves for the water years of our study.

\subsubsection{Tides}
The nearest ocean tide gauges to the Pescadero estuary are
operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
at Crissy Field in San Francisco, California (Station XXXX) as well as
in Monterey Harbor in Monterey, California (Station XXXX). Water
level in both locations are recorded every six minutes, and one minute
tsunami-capable unverified data is also recorded at these stations. The Northern Californian coast experiences a semidiurnal tide with a neap tide range of under 1 m and a spring tide range up to \emph{almost} 3 m (Figure~\ref{fig:QTH_2010_2012}b).


\subsubsection{Ocean wave climate}
Ocean wave conditions are obtained through NOAA National
Data Buoy Center (NDBC). NDBC buoy 46012 is located approximately 40 km
WNW of the Pescadero estuary in 208.8? m of water. This buoy reports
ocean significant wave height ever [X min]. [Note on deep water vs.
coastal]. Maximum wave heights in the ocean from 2010 - 2012 were over 7 m,
and minimum were under 1 m (Figure~\ref{fig:QTH_2010_2012}c). Ocean wave heights also follow a seasonal trend with typically smaller waves in the summer months transitioning to larger wave climates in the fall, winter and spring months when storms on the Pacific Ocean generate large swell.

\subsubsection{Wind}
Wind conditions are approximated by measurements at the Half Moon Bay airport (KHAF) during periods before the wind vane was installed in the Pescadero estuary.  There is good agreement in [Wind Speed? Direction], as shown in [FIGURE].

\subsubsection{Tsunami forcing}
The 2011 Tohoku earthquake generated a Pacific Ocean-wide tsunami (also known as a teletsunami). A description of the ocean state and the response of the Pescadero estuary to the forcing of the small amplitude tsunami that reached California is found in Chapter 5.

\section{Two main states: open and closed, plus some intermediate stuff}
\label{betterlabelmaybe}

With these observations, we have identified two main conditions for the
estaury: open and closed.  The inlet continuously contracts and [gets
bigger] with nearshore sand transport. Within the open state, tides in
the estuary may be an attenuated version of the ocean tides [Figure],
and this state we will consider to be fully open. An extensive
description of relevant hydrodynamic and salt transport processes in the
fully open state is found in Chapter 3 and 4. {Some words later on
interannual variability to open state? How much freshwater it takes to
freshen the estuary?}.

% ---------------------- figure end ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%------------------------

Because the estuarine inlet is in a constantly unstable condition, an
intermediate state between fully open and closed is also common in the
Pescadero estuary.  In this state, the sandy inlet is constricted,
probably due to accretion of sand at the bed of the inlet. Here, the
estuarine water level rises and falls in response to ocean tides, but
may only fill with the diurnal high high tide [Figure] or be severly
attenuated [Figure]. We consider this condition to be a
highly-constricted open state. Realistically, the open state of the
estuary is a continuum. Sand moves in and out of the inlet with tidal
flow and waves. High freshwater discharge will scour the mouth.

The closed state of the estuary is characterized by tidal depth
oscillations being shut off. This does not mean that the ocean tides
cease to influence water level in the estuary but that the water is not
outflowing through the channel. Variation in forcing within the closed
state depends on length of closure, to be discussed in section {X}.

Transitions between these two states are rapid.

[A note on closure.]

And, the transition from the closed state to open state in the Pescadero
estuary naturally occurs only when increased freshwater streamflow
overtops the sand bar at the mouth. It has been suggested in other
estuaries that storm waves overtopping the bar may breach the estuary
from the ocean side [CITE], but the mouth of the Pescadero estuary is
somewhat protected by the southern end cliff, and wave conditions
observed during our years of study make this unlikely. Given a storm
surge similar to that carried by Superstorm Sandy which created new
inlets in Barnegat Bay [CITE], this could be possible, but these are
very unlikely to occur in California's climate.

A description of estuarine dynamics during the closed and transitioning
states follows in this chapter, with the description of dynamics in the
open state to follow in the proceeding chapters.

\label{fig:beachriver_after} \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Closed estuarine water levels} \label{cl_wl}
The mouth of the Pescadero estuary closes when \emph{...[basically waves
so long as freshwater is low]...} Details about lagoon closure are
outside of the scope of this research, but relevant discussions on the
conditions necessary for lagoon closure can be found in [Dane's thesis
and his geomorphology paper]... The mouth of the Pescadero estuary is
somewhat unique in its protection by a cliff to the south side [Image -
mouth of Pescadero]. This cliff as well as the Highway 1 bridge piers
and \emph{[ground/dune stabilization]} prevent the migration of inlets
seen in some other California intermittently closed estuaries [CITE -
Dane's GRL paper?].

Immediately after closure, the mouth of the Pescadero estuary is still
low in elevation (Figure~\ref{fig:mouth_fb_20110825}). Throughout the closed period, we
expect the height of the sand berm to be equal to or slightly above the
height of the estuary water surface.

Initial lagoon infilling occurs primarily to ocean water overtopping the
low sand berm. Figure~\ref{fig:depthclosuref11} shows the estuarine water level and ocean
water level for the nine days following the mouth closure on August 23, 2011. 

There are at least two mechanisms by which ocean water enters the
Pescadero estuary during the closed mouth state. (1) Waves overtopping
berm directly into the estuary. (2) Waves overtopping the steep
(bermed?) beach, running down the beach and into the estuary: creates
river of sea water.

The second mechanism is less frequent (having been observed by this author once to a large degree and once to a small degree), and this event corresponds with 
the (X cm) rapid increase in lagoon water level on that day (Figure~\ref{fig:depthclosuref11}). A day
[a few days earlier] with a smaller wave climate only raised the estuary
water level by [X cm].

It is assumed that wave overwash carries salt water into the estuary and
grows the sand berm. A study on the [X estuary] in [somewhere] Australia
showed that \emph{XXXX} [Baldock et al., 2008]. \emph{Our observations suggest that wave overtopping in the Pescadero 
estuary occurs on an infragravity timescale, consistent with forcing seen in the open state of the estuary (SEE CHAPTER 3).}

Due to the hypsometry of the marsh, intial wave overwash is most
relevant to raising the water level in the closed lagoon. After a
certain point, the surface of the lagoon begins to spill across the
marsh and at this point filling becomes much more gradual. [Does the
berm get high enough to prevent ocean water from getting in?]. Because
nearshore forcing is primarily responsible for sand transport accreting
the sand berm at the mouth of the estuary, it is unlikely that a
condition exists where the mouth becomes high enough that ocean water
cannot enter. [Sand transport by wind may also shape the mouth...]

\subsubsection{Closed estuary velocity description} \label{cl_vel}
VELOCITY While the estuary is open to tidal influence, tides are the
main driver of flow (in the absence of very large freshwater discharge).
After the inlet closes, tidal forcing is cut off. Velocity measurements
show that: {What do velocity measurements show?}

\subsubsection{Closed estuary salt and temperature structure} \label{cl_strat}
STRATIFICATION: SALT * Evolution of stratification (saltier, freshwater
surface layer). * Wedderburn number. The Wedderburn number is a
nondimensional number used to compare wind stress (?) to stratification
and is an indicator of [what it would take to mix a stratified water
column]. The number is a comparsion of [quick derivation here].


* Maybe a potential density anomaly?


* Mixing events: The high Wedderburn number means that the freshwater
sitting on the surface of the estuary acts to protect salt-stratified
lower water from mixing due to wind stress induced shear... Occasionally
the wind blows (hard enough and/or long enough) to upwell the
pycnocline. [Figures - wind, salt]. If this occurs, the wind stress can
act directly on the pycnocline. [Descriptions of the figures here]. 
THis appears to be the primary mechanism of significant mixing during
the closed state.  [February 13, 2012].



Hypothesize on mixing of intruding salt. Some parameterization?

TEMPERATURE. (Important to fish). Stratification in the Pescadero
estuary is always dependent on salt. [Because equation of state].
Temperature in the estuary in the closed state{HERE} depends on the salt
stratification. Observations show that after the estuary has closed and
a freshwater layer is present, water temperature in the mixed surface
waters follow a diurnal trend of warming and cooling in accordance with
solar heating. The salt-stratified lower layer of the estuary does not
'feel' this diurnal heating, and in fact is much warmer than the surface
water. [Figure: temperature during closed state].


An observed example of wind setup and mixing occurred just prior to the
sand bar breach on November 24, 2010. In situ velocity and salinity
measurements combined with wind measurements at Half Moon Bay airport
are used to understand this event:

On November 23, wind forcing was seaward, small surface velocities in
the Pescadero estuary were consistent with this forcing, and the water
column was vertically stratified. Three layer flow apparent in this
state may be due to the bathymetry of the estuary where the lower end of
the estuary is very shallow. Wind shear may drive surface flow
downstream, and the lower water column will respond by flowing upstream.
At the sensors, [sentence on trapped lower water].

From this point, the wind direction slowly shifted to become landward,
and on November 23 at (X pm) GMT, the wind picked up to 10 m
s\textsuperscript{-1}. The water column responded immediatedly to this
increased wind shear with surface flow in line with the wind and the
deeper water column compensating with flow in the other direction.
Three-layer flow may not be seen because the upper estuary is deeper and
the end of the estuary [has a sharp wall instead of a shallow lagoon
thing]. Salinity measurements suggest that the strong wind forcing
caused slight upwelling of saltier water at the DS mooring, and
significant downwelling of fresher water at US as the deeper sensor
there went from measuring [15-20] PSU water to [5] PSU water in [X]
hours.

At [XX:XX] on November 24, the wind falls down to 5 m
s\textsuperscript{-1} and the water column relaxes, as evidence by flow
reversal. The surface mixed layer at the ADCP is shallower as seen by
comparing the depth of highest shear at the setup event several hours
earlier to the relaxation event, as well as by looking at the salinity
sensors. As the relaxation occurs, the [surface mixed layer becomes
thicker], but mid-column sensors end up fresher than prior to the mixing
event.

It is upon this slightly more well-mixed background that the lagoon
mouth breach occurs, and it is difficult to determine an exact moment of
estuarine breaching...

*** Three (?) things drive mixing in this state. The first: direct input
of wind shear at the surface creating shear in the water column.  The
second is shear by interfacial drag mid-column. And a third process may
be movement of the lower water column against the bed creating [... more
shear].

These effects may be parameterized in the following way:

\subsection{Breach.. } \label{breach_dynamics}

breach data: salt response
velocity...? (backward order?)


BREACH: Instruments recorded 5 (I think) opening events in the Pescadero
estuary. The date of the breach, maximum Q in the [24?] hours preceding
the breach, water level before the breach (maybe), ocean wave climate,
and [tide something] are given in table [TABLE OF BREACH DATA THAT SEEMS
RELEVANT TO ME].

{Disclaimer: No measurements on top of marsh, few measurements in
creeks... data can show what passes by sensors in lower estuary. When I
say estuary, I mean estuary where measurements were made. High water
level means salt can extend farther upstream than normal... didn't
measure there}.

Based on measurements as the sand berm at the mouth breached, two types
of events occurs: one where the entire (lower) estuary is freshened, and
the second where mixing occurs in the fresh surface layer and the
stratified lower layer, but salt water is retained in the depths of the
estuary. [Could maybe do a HOW MUCH ENERGY TO FLUSH BOTTOM WATERS
estimation].

Here I present data of salt and/or velocity from as many breach events
as I can present data for.
