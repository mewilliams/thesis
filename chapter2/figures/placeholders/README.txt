Data from deepest mooring in the Pescadero estuary for four breach events in 2011-12 season. In each case a 2-day plot is shown.  Note how some events (11/2011 and 1/2012) show rapid draining of the lagoon, while others (2/2012 and 3/2012) show slow draining.  Correspondingly, the rapid events show mixing of the water column while the slow drain events indicate some mixing in each layer, but a general 2-layer structure remains.

Note: the bed sensor in March 2012 (black line) was probably fouled and giving bad salinity data (sometimes). I think the jumps are not real.
