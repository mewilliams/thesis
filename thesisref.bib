	Abstract = {Abstract 
Bar-built estuaries with relatively small (cross sectional area \&lt; 100 m2) and shallow tidal inlets are widespread in Mediterranean climates and along wave-exposed coasts. While similarly important to coastal sediment balances and estuarine ecosystems and more numerous than larger inlet systems, they suffer from a relative lack of understanding. This is especially true regarding the process of inlet closure, when the channel is filled with sediment deposited by wave-driven processes. Mouth closure is of growing concern owing to changes in inlet behavior in many systems in response to human influences. The use of many existing conceptual and quantitative models for closure is precluded by rapid morphological change, unsteady freshwater inputs, and difficulties in scaling well-established inlet relationships in these smaller systems. In this paper, over 60 years of daily closure records are analyzed for the Russian River mouth, a prototypical bar-built system in northern California. We show that the time-dependent closure pattern can be explained by an interaction of processes that act to scour the inlet (driven by tides and river) with those that act to deposit sand in the inlet (driven by waves). Tidal, weather-related, seasonal, and interannual cycles are observed. We improve an existing parametric model to evaluate these separate influences and show that it works well for predicting closure events at both the tidal and seasonal scales. Finally, we compare our data with closure records from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to show that inlet closures have become shorter and more sporadic over time at this site and to identify anthropogenic drivers of this observed change.},

@article{maccready_advances_2010,
	Abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of estuarine circulation and salinity structure are reviewed. We focus on well- and partially mixed systems that are long relative to the tidal excursion. Dynamics of the coupled system of width- and tidally averaged momentum and salt equations are now better understood owing to the development of simple numerical solution techniques. These have led to a greater appreciation of the key role played by the time dependency of the length of the salt intrusion. Improved realism in simplified tidally averaged physics has been driven by simultaneous advances in our understanding of the detailed dynamics within the tidal cycle and across irregular channel cross-sections. The complex interactions of turbulence, stratification, and advection are now understood well enough to motivate a new generation of physically plausible mixing parameterizations for the tidally averaged equations.},

@article{malhadas_effect_2009,
	Abstract = {This study reports the role of waves, tide, wind and freshwater discharges over the sea level in {\'O}bidos Lagoon, a coastal system connected to the sea through a narrow and shallow mobile inlet. To address the hydrodynamic features of this coastal system, the relative importance of different physical forcings were evaluated. For this purpose, observations together with realistic and idealized numerical modeling were used. Both model and measurements show that the lagoon sea level remains above offshore sea level during storm wave periods. Hence, a simplified inlet-lagoon idealized model was described through mathematical expressions, to understand and highlight the physical processes responsible for sea-level elevation.

In general, it can be concluded that multiple forcing conditions, specifically tide and waves, are important in defining the dynamics of the {\'O}bidos Lagoon. The variability of the lagoon sea level is 80\% due to tide and 20\% due to waves. A correlation was found with wave height and sea-level elevation during high wave activity periods; no correlation was found for low wave activity. A significant super-elevation on lagoon sea level occurs during storm wave periods. Such super-elevation is explained, not only by wave set-up or radiation stresses due to waves, but also by tidal inlet morphology (mainly depth and length).},

@article{ranasinghe_circulation_1999,
	Abstract = {Tidal inlets in microtidal, wave-dominated coastal environments tend to close to the ocean seasonally. This obstructs navigation and could cause degradation of water quality in the estuary/lagoon connected to the inlet. Hence, engineering solutions are often implemented to prevent inlet closure. However, a prior knowledge of circulation and mixing processes within the estuary is crucial for the sustainability of any engineering solution. This paper attempts to provide insight into circulation and mixing characteristics of seasonally open estuaries based on the results of a field study undertaken at Wilson Inlet, a typical seasonally open estuary, in south-western Australia. Results of the study indicate that this type of estuary may have two distinct behavioural patterns, in winter and in summer. During winter, solar heating causes density stratification during daytime, and convective cooling causes overnight de-stratification; a horizontal cyclonic gyre is established during winter by the combined action of the Coriolis force and streamflow. During summer, strong sea breezes ({\textasciitilde}10 m s$^{\textrm{\&\#8211;1}}$ ) cause vertical mixing during daytime, and convective cooling vertically mixes the water column at night. When the inlet is open, sea water propagates into the estuary during flooding tides unless streamflows are very high.},

@article{rich_hydrologic_2013,
	Abstract = {Abstract
To better understand how the hydrology of bar-built estuaries affects breaching and closing patterns, a model is developed that incorporates an estuary hydrologic budget with a geomorphic model of the inlet system. Erosion of the inlet is caused by inlet flow, whereas the only morphologic effect of waves is the deposition of sand into the inlet. When calibrated, the model is able to reproduce the initial seasonal breaching, seasonal closure, intermittent closures and breaches, and the low-streamflow (closed state) estuary hydrology of the Carmel Lagoon, located in Central California. Model performance was tested against three separate years of water-level observations. When open during these years, the inlet was visually observed to drain directly across the beach berm, in accordance with model assumptions. The calibrated model predicts the observed 48-h estuary stage amplitude with root mean square errors of 0.45 m, 0.39 m and 0.42 m for the three separate years. For the calibrated model, the probability that the estuary inlet is closed decreases exponentially with increasing inflow (streamflow plus wave overtopping), decreasing 10-fold in probability as mean daily inflow increases from 0.2 to 1.0 m3/s. Seasonal patterns of inlet state reflect the seasonal pattern of streamflow, though wave overtopping may become the main hydrologic flux during low streamflow conditions, infrequently causing short-lived breaches. In a series of sensitivity analyses it is seen that the status of the inlet and storage of water are sensitive to factors that control the storage, transmission, and inflow of water. By varying individual components of the berm system and estuary storage, the amount of the time the estuary is open may increase by 57\%, or decrease by 44\%, compared to the amount of time the estuary is open during calibrated model conditions for the 18.2-year model period. The individual components tested are: berm height, width, length, and hydraulic conductivity; estuary hypsometry (storage to stage relationship); two factors that control wave-swash sedimentation of the inlet; and sea level rise. The elevation of the berm determines the volume of water that must enter the estuary in order to breach, and it modulates the wave-overtopping flux and frequency. By increasing estuary storage capacity, the estuary will breach less frequently (− 27\% change in time open for modeled excavation scenario) and store water up to 3 months later into the summer. Altering beach aquifer hydraulic conductivity affects inlet state, and patterns of breaching and water storage. As a result of sea-level rise of 1.67 m by 2100, and a beach berm that remains in its current location and accretes vertically, the amount of time the estuary remains open may decrease by 44\%. Such a change is an end-member of likely scenarios given that the berm will translate landwards. Model results indicate that the amount of time the estuary is open is more sensitive to changes in wave run-up than the amount of sand deposited in the inlet per each overtopping wave.},
