	Abstract = {Concise and focused-these are the two guiding principles of Young, Munson, and Okiishi's Third Edition of A Brief Introduction to Fluid Mechanics. The authors clearly present basic analysis techniques and address practical concerns and applications, such as pipe flow, open-channel flow, flow measurement, and drag and lift. Homework problems in every chapter-including open-ended problems, problems based on the {CD}-{ROM} videos, laboratory problems, and computer problems-emphasize the practical application of principles. More than 100 worked examples provide detailed solutions to a variety of problems. The Third Edition offers several new features and enhancements, including: A variety of new simple figures in the margins that will help you visualize the concepts described in the text.Chapter Summary and Study Guide sections at the end of each chapter that will help you assess your understanding of the material.Simplified presentation of the Reynolds transport theorem.New homework problems added to every chapter.Highlighted key works in each chapter.Experience fluid flow phenomena in action on a new {CD}-{ROM}! The Fluid Mechanics Phenomena {CD}-{ROM} packaged with this text presents: 75 short video segments that illustrate various aspects of fluid mechanics30 extended laboratory-type {problemsActual} experimental data for simple experiments in an Excel format168 review problems.},

	Abstract = {To investigate the role that estuaries play in the survival of steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss, we compared juvenile size at ocean entry with back-calculated measures of size at ocean entry for returning adults in Scott Creek, a representative California coastal stream. During the annual spring emigration, the largest smolts ({\textgreater}150 mm fork length ({FL})) move directly to sea, while some smaller smolts remain in the estuary until sandbar formation creates a closed freshwater lagoon. High growth rates in the estuary throughout the summer result in a near doubling of fork length from the time of estuary entry (mean {FL} of spring migrants = 102.2 mm; mean {FL} of fall lagoon resident = 195.9 mm). Analysis of the scale morphology of returning adult steelhead indicates that there is strong size-dependent mortality at sea, with estuary-reared steelhead showing a large survival advantage, comprising between 87\% and 95.5\% (based on tag returns and scale analysis, respectively) of the returning adult population despite be..., Afin d'estimer le r{\^o}le jou{\'e} par les estuaires dans la survie de la truite arc-en-ciel anadrome, Oncorhynchus mykiss, nous avons compar{\'e} la taille des jeunes au moment de leur arriv{\'e}e en mer avec les mesures obtenues par r{\'e}trocalcul de la taille des adultes qui reviennent de l'oc{\'e}an au moment de leur propre entr{\'e}e en mer dans Scott Creek, un cours d'eau c{\^o}tier typique de Californie.

@article{hayes_steelhead_2008,
	Abstract = {Abstract We monitored growth and life history pathways of juvenile steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss and compared growth rates between the upper watershed and estuary in Scott Creek, a typical California coastal stream. Growth in the upper watershed was approximately linear from May to December for age-0 fish. For passive integrated transponder ({PIT}) tagged, age-1+ fish, growth transitioned to a cyclic pattern, peaking at 0.2\% per day during February-April, when maximum flows and temperatures of 7-12$\,^{\circ}$C occurred. Growth of {PIT}-tagged fish then slowed during August-September (0.01\% per day), when temperatures were 14-18$\,^{\circ}$C and flows were low. During each spring, smolts (mean fork length [{FL}] $\pm$ {SE} = 98.0 $\pm$ 1.2 mm) and fry migrated to the estuary; some fish remained there during summer-fall as low flows and waves resulted in seasonal sandbar formation, which created a warm lagoon and restricted access to the ocean. Growth in the estuary-lagoon was much higher (0.2-0.8\% per day at 15-24$\,^{\circ}$C). Our data suggest the existence of three juvenile life history pathways: Upper-watershed rearing, estuary-lagoon rearing, and combined upper-watershed and estuary-lagoon rearing. We present a model based upon the above data that reports size at age for each juvenile life history type. The majority of fish reaching typical steelhead ocean entry sizes (âˆ¼150-250 mm {FL}; age 0.8-3.0) were estuary-lagoon reared, which indicates a disproportionate contribution of this habitat type to survival of Scott Creek steelhead. In contrast, steelhead from higher latitudes rear in tributaries during summer, taking several years to attain ocean entry size.},
