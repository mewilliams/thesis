% Third: Field help
Measurements in the Pescadero estuary would not have been possible with out field assistance from a long list of people. Along with my promises of a day at the beach, Mother Nature often delivered cold water, buried moorings, wind, and rain. I am especially thankful for the willingness of several people to spend hours digging in the sand below cold moving water... Not included in this dissertation is our finding that it is impossible to dig a milk crate sized hole in the sand below 40 cm of water without it filling in... but concerted efforts were made nonetheless.  For this help and more, I thank: Cristina Poindexter, Audric Collignon, Andreas Brand (without whom I may still be trying to figure out how to build and deploy mooorings), Susan Willis, Rusty Holleman, Wayne Wagner, Rocky Geyer, Jordon Hemingway, Kevin Hsu, Rudi Schuech, Ian Tse, Mark Stacey, Felix Sturm, Bowen Zhao, Lauren Goodfriend, Andy Torkelson, Jason Simon, Dave Weirsema, DJ Gaker, Eric Huber, Dane Behrens, Nate Butler, Justin Jasper, Gabrielle Boisrame, Arthur Wiedmer, Gabriele Bellani, Hugh Wagner, Julia Schoen, Ryan Sanders, and those friends and collegues whose assistance I failed to write down in my field notebook.
