	Abstract = {More than 131 × 106 metric tons ({MT}) of inorganic sediments accumulated in coastal wetlands when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita crossed the Louisiana coast in 2005, plus another 281 × 106 {MT} when accumulation was prorated for open water area. The annualized combined amount of inorganic sediments per hurricane equals (i) 12\% of the Mississippi River's suspended load, (ii) 5.5 times the inorganic load delivered by overbank flooding before flood protection levees were constructed, and (iii) 227 times the amount introduced by a river diversion built for wetland restoration. The accumulation from hurricanes is sufficient to account for all the inorganic sediments in healthy saltmarsh wetlands.},

	Abstract = {Measurements from {NASA} {IceBridge} airborne surveys in March/April 2009--2013 over the western Arctic Ocean are presented in the context of previous observations to assess changes in the characteristics of the sea ice cover during the last decade, taking into account spatial and temporal limitations in the available data. Following a precipitous drop in the amount and thickness of multiyear ({MY}) ice in 2007--2008, the characteristics of the ice cover have remained largely consistent through March 2013. The central Arctic continues to be dominated by {MY} ice with mean and modal thicknesses of 3.2 m and 2.4 m, respectively. The southern Beaufort and Chukchi Sea region is a complex mixture of 75\% first-year ice and 25\% {MY} ice. {IceBridge} observations indicate that the mean thickness in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas may have decreased from 2.5 m to as low as 1.6 m over the 5 year period.},

@article{masselink_swash-zone_2006,
	Abstract = {Hydrodynamic forcing with respect to sediment transport and morphologic change, paying particular attention to relevant swash asymmetries, is reviewed. The hydrodynamics are categorized into their individual effects: high- and low-frequency motions, bores and turbulence, in/exfiltration, shear stresses and friction coefficients. Individual effects are then related to their potential for driving or influencing sediment transport and morphological change. Additional concepts such as settling/scour lag and sediment advection that have largely been ignored are also discussed. A simple framework is presented for the morphological response of the beachface under swash zone hydrodynamic processes. The framework acknowledges that the beachface cannot be considered in isolation from the surf zone and that the two zones are strongly linked through feedback processes. The swash zone itself is also a morphodynamic system and morphological response occurs as a result of disequilibrium between the beachface gradient and asymmetries in the swash hydrodynamics. Any beachface morphological development in response to such equilibrium will have direct and indirect effects on swash hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes. It is concluded that the two issues requiring most urgent research attention with regards to swash zone sediment transport processes are the roles of sediment advection and longshore swash motion.},

@article{nyman_roles_1995,
	Abstract = {The passage of hurricane Andrew across the Louisiana coastal zone in 1992 was used to study the effects of hurricane sedimentation on estuarine marshes. (1) The thickness and nutrient content of hurricane sediments, (2) the composition of hurricane sediments relative to pre-existing sediments, and (3) the relationship between hurricane sedimentation and small-scale heterogeneity in the emergent plant community were investigated. Vertical accretion resulting from the hurricane was 4-11 times greater than the long-term (30 year) annual rate. The hurricane sediments will be within the root zone of emergent vegetation for 35-50 years, depending on the local marsh vertical accretion rate. Element concentration, organic matter content, and texture of hurricane sediments varied over a wide area, which suggested that hurricane sediments did not originate from a common sediment pool. The concentration of most elements analysed did not differ between hurricane sediments and pre-existing sediments, which suggested that hurricane sediments originated primarily from the same local bays and lakes that provide material for other sedimentation events. Hurricane sediments were thicker {inJuncus} roemerianusstands than in {surroundingSpartina} alterniflorastands. Greater hurricane sedimentation {inJ}. roemerianusstands was attributed to greater stem density there and may help maintain plant community heterogeneity {ifJ}. roemerianusis less flood-tolerant {thanS}. alterniflora, as previous work suggests. Previous studies have noted the effect of environmental gradients on plant species distribution, but our data indicate that plant species can also generate different environmental conditions associated with their distribution.},

@article{raga_impact_2001,
	Abstract = {We present calculations to estimate potential changes to the local climate and photochemistry caused by pollutants (gases and particles) produced in Mexico City, and the implications for the regional scale when pollutants are exported to surrounding regions. Measured aerosol optical properties are used in a 2-stream delta-Eddington radiative transfer model (Slingo and Schrecker, 1982. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society 108, 407--426) to estimate net radiative fluxes and heating rates, while photolysis rates for nitrogen dioxide and ozone are estimated from a much more detailed model (Madronich, 1987. Journal of Geophysical Research 92, 9740--9752). The presence of highly absorbing aerosols in Mexico City leads to a 17.6\% reduction in solar radiative flux at the surface when an optical depth of 0.55 is considered. Photolysis rates for nitrogen dioxide and ozone are reduced between 18 and 21\% at the surface, while an increase of between 15 and 17\% is predicted above the boundary layer, for local noon calculations.The non-uniform vertical structure of aerosol concentrations observed (P{\'e}rez Vidal and Raga, 1998. Atmosfera 11, 95--108) plays a significant role in determining localized regions of heating, i.e. stabilization at the top of the boundary layer that results in a temperature increase of 0.4K h−1 at that level. The presence of a 200 m-deep aerosol layer at the top of the boundary layer results in vertical profiles of the photolysis rates that are significantly different from the case where the aerosols are uniformly distributed in the mixed layer. At the bottom of the aerosol layer (about 1 km above the surface), the rates are about 28\% lower than when there is a uniform aerosol distribution in the boundary layer. Finally, there is also an enhancement of photolysis rates at the top of the boundary layer that may lead to increased ozone production compared to the non-aerosol case.},

@article{de_jonge_influence_2014,
	Abstract = {Active deepening of tidal channels usually results in the alteration of the vertical and the horizontal tide. This may lead to concurrent significant increases in mean suspended matter concentrations ({SPM}) in coastal plain estuaries, the turbidity maximum ({ETM}) included. This is exemplified by an extensive analysis of the Ems estuary, a prototypical heavily stressed estuary in the Dutch-German border area. Measurements show that the {SPM} concentrations in the lower reaches of the estuary have increased an average of 2- to 3-fold between 1954 and 2005, with a 10-fold increase observed in the upper estuary (tidal river). Longitudinal profiles of surface {SPM} demonstrate that the {ETM} has moved upstream by up to 25 km and has broadened into a zone 30 km in length which extends into the freshwater tidal river. On an annual scale, variations in freshwater discharge significantly influence the formation and breakdown of the {ETM}: during low river discharge the {ETM} approaches equilibrium over 2--3 months, whilst elevated river discharges relocate the {ETM} downstream over several weeks.
An exploratory, semi-analytical model is calibrated to simulate the equilibrium {SPM} distribution in the upper estuary during five time periods from 1965 to 2005, using archival bathymetric and tidal data. Results suggest that the deepening of tidal channels and a reduction in hydraulic drag have most likely resulted in a landward shift of the {SPM} trapping location. The measured increase in {SPM} concentrations and the development of fluid mud around the 1990s likely contributed to reduced mixing and bottom drag, creating a feedback loop that further altered tidal and {SPM} dynamics. It is argued that the removal of some non-erodible (consolidated) layers in the lower reaches of the estuary has created new internal sediment sources that may be responsible for feeding the observed high {SPM} concentrations, rather than increased sediment input from the boundaries. All findings are based on and supported by measured short-term seasonal fluctuations, as well as long-term developments of yearly averaged concentrations in the longitudinal {SPM} distribution.},

Maximum zero-to-peak tsunami amplitudes and currents are tabulated for 131 sites along the North American coast.

The three earthquakes modeled are moment magnitude 8.8, 8.5, and 7.8. Maximum zero-to-peak tsunami amplitude for {theMw} = 8.8 earthquake is near 6 m normal to the fault break and maximum current is near 3.5 m/s. Maximum amplitudes decrease by about one-half north and south of the fault break in the source region. Tsunami amplitudes vary along the Alaskan coast from less than 0.5 to 1.6 m. The modeled amplitudes for {theMw} = 8.8 quake decrease to less than 0.4 m south of Point Conception, {CA}. {TheMw} = 7.8 earthquake generates a tsunami with a maximum amplitude of less than 1 m normal to the source. North and south of the fault break the maximum amplitude again decreases by about one-half. In all the models, amplitudes and currents arc less than one-sixth of the outer coast value within Puget Sound.},

@article{moreno_morphodynamics_2010,
	Abstract = {Coastal lagoons are valuable water bodies since they are of great ecological and economic interest throughout the world. Their existence is controlled by variations in sea level and the geological substrate of their location. Their morphology is linked to local topography, alternation of high and low pressure, the presence of a river, as well as tidal regime. All these factors influence lagoons along the coastline in the south of Spain. The main morphological characteristics of such lagoons are the following: intermittence, one-dimensional morphology, small size, shallow waters, high area/depth ratio, no flood- or ebb tide deltas, overwash of their low barriers during storms, high evaporation rates and feeding by rivers.
Effective management of these systems requires the evaluation not only of their hydrodynamics and opening and closure rate, but also the prediction of possible future scenarios as a response to meteorological events. This paper describes the behavior of a coastal lagoon in Zahara de los Atunes (C{\'a}diz) by means of a numerical model implemented with the objective of serving as a tool for optimizing the coastal zone management.
Although the coastal lagoon at Zahara de los Atunes is closed most of the year, it is artificially opened at the beginning of the summer. The results of our study showed that during this period, the lagoon is flood-dominated with a pumping-mode response. It naturally tends to close since it is a trap for littoral drift sediments. The precise date of closure depends on the events that take place during the autumn, which determine whether the sediments deposited in the inlet by the littoral drift are flushed out by the river flow or flushed in by the waves.},

	Abstract = {{\textbackslash}Equations are developed for the tidally-averaged, width-averaged estuarine salinity and circulation in a rectangular estuary. Width and depth may vary along the length of the channel, as may coefficients of vertical turbulent mixing and along channel diffusion. The system is reduced to a single first-order, nonlinear, ordinary differential equation governing the section-averaged salinity. A technique for specifying the ocean boundary condition is given, and solutions are found by numerical integration. Under different assumptions for the diffusion it is possible to reproduce the few existing analytical solutions, in particular the Hansen and Rattray (1965) Central Regime solution, and Chatwin's (1976) solution.   The mathematical framework allows easy comparison of the results of different channel geometries and mixing coefficients. Of particular interest is the along-channel distribution of the diffusive fraction of up-estuary salt flux. It is shown that the Hansen and Rattray solution is always diffusion-dominated near the mouth. A theory is presented for estimating the diffusion coefficient within a tidal excursion of the mouth. It is shown that the resulting rapid along-channel increase of diffusion may explain some observed patterns of salinity structure: a decrease in both stratification and along-channel salinity gradient near the mouth. The theory is applied to the Delaware Estuary and Northern San Francisco Bay, and shows reasonable agreement with observed sensitivities of salt intrusion distance to river How.},

	Abstract = {A tidal bore is a series of waves propagating upstream as the tidal flow turns to rising. It forms during spring tide conditions when the tidal range exceeds 4 to 6 m and the flood tide is confined to a narrow funnelled estuary. Its existence is based upon a fragile hydrodynamic balance between the tidal amplitude, the freshwater river flow conditions and the river channel bathymetry, and it is shown that this balance may be easily disturbed by changes in boundary conditions and freshwater inflow. This book demystifies the physics of a tidal bore and it thoroughly documents the tidal bores on our planet with reliable and accurate information. It aims to cultivate a passion for a beautiful, but fragile geophysical process, with in-depth updated content and by over 190 illustrations and photographs.},

	Abstract = {This paper is a contribution to the understanding of the topoclimatic and environmental geography of the basin where Santiago --- one of the most polluted Latin American city -- is located. In the first part, land-use change is analysed looking at the climatic transformation caused by the rapid transit from natural semiarid surface to urban areas. In the second part, seasonal weather and daily cycles of slope winds and the available ventilation are described trying to relate those patterns with the spatial distribution of air pollution. A combination of meteorological, geographical and cultural factors explain extreme air pollution events: meteorologically, Santiago is under permanent subsidence inversion layers. Geographically, the city is located in a closed basin surrounded by mountains. Culturally, the urban area has the highest population concentration (40\% of the national total), industries (near 70\% of the total) and vehicles, which are the main sources of smog. The urban and suburban transport system is based on a large number of buses (diesel) and private cars, both experiencing a rapid growth from the past few years. The city and specially the transport system generates high emissions of pollutant, but the natural semiarid deforested soils and slopes are also important sources. The local wind system can explain the differential spatial distribution on the concentration of air pollutants in the city and its periphery. In winter (rain season) concentrations of particulate matter are higher at the centre and the {SW} part of the city. The andean piedmont area (E part of the city) shows minimum values, suggesting major ventilation effects of slope and valley winds. Ozone exceeds air quality standards in summer (dry season) at all sites in the centre and periphery. However, the O3-concentrations are higher on preferred residential areas located at the piedmont area (E part of the city), suggesting air pollution transport effects. Currently, there is no consideration of these local climatic features in the process of urban planning.},

@article{ralston_sediment_2013,
	Abstract = {Tropical Storms Irene and Lee in 2011 produced intense precipitation and flooding in the U.S. Northeast, including the Hudson River watershed. Sediment input to the Hudson River was approximately 2.7 megaton, about 5 times the long-term annual average. Rather than the common assumption that sediment is predominantly trapped in the estuary, observations and model results indicate that approximately two thirds of the new sediment remained trapped in the tidal freshwater river more than 1 month after the storms and only about one fifth of the new sediment reached the saline estuary. High sediment concentrations were observed in the estuary, but the model results suggest that this was predominantly due to remobilization of bed sediment. Spatially localized deposits of new and remobilized sediment were consistent with longer term depositional records. The results indicate that tidal rivers can intercept (at least temporarily) delivery of terrigenous sediment to the marine environment during major flow events.},

@article{rustomji_flood_2007,
	Abstract = {Wave-dominated estuaries are affected by floods generated in their hinterland catchments as well as marine tide and wave processes. The interaction of these terrestrial and marine influences controls the opening regime of the estuary. Despite the well documented environmental pressures on estuaries including elevated nutrient loadings and abstraction of river flows, little research concerning the variability and controls on estuary mouth opening regimes exists. From water level observations of Tuross Lake estuary in south-eastern Australia, the estuary's recent opening regime is reconstructed and shown to vary significantly over time. Floodwaters fill the estuary and scour the estuary mouth, enhancing the exchange of marine water between the estuary and the ocean, which manifests as an increased tidal range within the estuary. Between floods, tide and wave activity caused aggradation of the estuary mouth such that the tidal range within the estuary declined by 0.5--0.7 mm per day as the mouth became more constricted. Under conditions of low river flow, high evaporative losses and seasonal reductions in ocean wave height, the estuary mouth can close completely. Using twentieth century streamflow estimates, it is shown that hydrologic variability is likely to have resulted in large variations in the estuary's opening regime. Since 2000, there have been relatively few flood-driven scour events and this explains the relatively congested state of the current estuary mouth. Predicted hydrologic changes under enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are also likely to enhance the variability in the estuary's opening regime.},

@article{maccready_model_2009,
	Abstract = {A numerical simulation of circulation in the Columbia River estuary and plume during the summer of 2004 is used to explore the mixing involved as river water is transformed into shelf water. The model is forced with realistic river flow, tides, wind stress, surface heat flux, and ocean boundary conditions. Simulated currents and water properties on the shelf near the mouth are compared with records from three moorings (all in 72 m of water) and five {CTD} sections. The model is found to have reasonable skill; statistically significant correlations between observed and modeled surface currents, temperature, and salinity are all 0.42--0.72 for the mooring records. Equations for the tidally averaged, volume-integrated mechanical energy budget (kinetic and potential) are derived, with attention to the effects of: (i) Reynolds averaging, (ii) a time varying volume due to the free surface, and (iii) dissipation very close to the bottom. It is found that convergence of tidal pressure work is the most important forcing term in the estuary. In the far field plume (which has a volume 15 times greater than that of the estuary), the net forcing is weaker than that in the estuary, and may be due to either tidal currents or wind stress depending on the time period considered. These forcings lead to irreversible mixing of the stratification (buoyancy flux) that turns river water into shelf water. This occurs in both the plume and estuary, but appears to be more efficient (17\% vs. 5\%), and somewhat greater (4.2 {MW} vs. 3.3 {MW}), in plume vs. estuary. This demonstrates the importance of both wind and tidal forcing to watermass transformation, and the need to consider the estuary and plume as part of a single system.},

	Abstract = {West Coast estuaries are geologically young and composed of a variety of geomorphological types. These estuaries range from large fjords to shallow lagoons; from large to low freshwater flows. Natural hazards include El Ni{\~n}os, strong Pacific storms, and active tectonic activity. West Coast estuaries support a wide range of living resources: five salmon species, harvestable shellfish, waterfowl and marine birds, marine mammals, and a variety of algae and plants. Although populations of many of these living resources have declined (salmonids), others have increased (marine mammals). West Coast estuaries are also centers of commerce and increasingly large shipping traffic. The West Coast human population is rising faster than most other areas of the U. S. and Canada, and is distributed heavily in southern California, the San Francisco Bay area, around Puget Sound, and the Fraser River estuary. While water pollution is a problem in many of the urbanized estuaries, most estuaries do not suffer from poor water quality. Primary estuarine problems include habitat alterations, degradation, and loss; diverted freshwater flows; marine sediment contamination; and exotic species introductions. The growing West Coast economy and population are in part related to the quality of life, which is dependent on the use and enjoyment of abundant coastal natural resources.},

	Abstract = {Several recent publications have documented changes in river discharge from arctic and subarctic watersheds. Comparison of these findings, however, has been hampered by differences in time periods and methods of analysis. Here we compare changes in discharge from different regions of the pan-arctic watershed using identical time periods and analytical methods. Discharge to the Arctic Ocean increased by 5.6 km3/y/y during 1964--2000, the net result of a large increase from Eurasia moderated by a small decrease from North America. In contrast, discharge to Hudson/James/Ungava Bays decreased by 2.5 km3/y/y during 1964--2000. While this evaluation identifies an overall increase in discharge (∼120 km3/y greater discharge at the end of the time period as compared to the beginning for Hudson/James/Unvaga Bays and the Arctic Ocean combined), the contrasting regional trends also highlight the need to understand the consequences of adding/removing freshwater from particular regions of the arctic and subarctic oceans.},

	Abstract = {A numerical model that combines wind waves with tidal fluxes in a tidal basin is presented and validated. The model couples a hydrodynamic finite element module based on the shallow water equations with a finite volume module that accounts for the generation and propagation of wind waves. The wave module solves the wave action conservation on the same triangular mesh used in the hydrodynamic module, thus efficiently reproducing the physical relationships between waves and tide propagation. The combined wind wave--tidal model is applied to the Venice lagoon, Italy. The highly irregular bathymetry of this tidal environment, characterized by deep channels, emergent salt marshes, and extensive tidal flats, suggests the introduction of specific hypotheses that simplify the governing equations with a noteworthy increase in efficiency and robustness of the algorithm. Particular attention is devoted to the dissipation of wave energy at the steep boundaries between channels, tidal flats, and salt marshes. Simulations of wave fields generated under specific wind conditions are presented and discussed. The model results are compared, with good agreement, to field data collected in different stations inside the lagoon of Venice. Finally, evidence of the complementary effect of tidal currents and wind waves on bottom shear stresses is presented using the results of different simulations.},

@article{silva_seasonal_2012,
	Abstract = {Abstract Longshore sediment transport ({LST}) is a major driver of coastal evolution. However, despite the recognition that it presents an unsteady behavior at the seasonal scale, the variability at longer term scales (interannual and decadal) is still far from being properly acknowledged. The present work contributes to the understanding of the seasonal to decadal variability of the {LST}, benefiting from recent developments in wave hindcast modeling. This work was developed for the northwest coast of Portugal, which is fully exposed to the highly energetic wave regime generated in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean that induces unusually large {LST} rates. Hindcast offshore waves, between 1953 and 2010, were used as offshore forcing to deduce {LST} estimates. The mean annual {LST}, between 1953 and 2010, shows an irregular and noncyclic pattern. Computed mean annual {LST}, for this coastal stretch, is around 1 million cubic meters directed to the south, with yearly averages ranging from 108,000 to 2.24 million m3 year−1 always directed to the south. The maximum observed annual {LST} magnitude exceeds the mean magnitude by more than 100\%. The variability in {LST} magnitude was found to be mainly related to the {LST} magnitudes of autumn/winter months in response to the wave regime seasonality. Results show that to estimate the long-term {LST} within an error of about 20\%, a period of about 10 years of data/observations is required. Interannual variability in the magnitude of the {LST} was found to be correlated with the annual North Atlantic Oscillation ({NAO}) index. In the years where the {NAO} index was higher, the mean annual {LST} was generally greater than the long-term average, while negative {NAO} index corresponds to lower than average {LST} estimates.},

	Abstract = {Estuaries have been defined in a variety of ways [1]. From the perspective of fresh water and salt balance, `` An estuary is a semi-enclosed coastal body of water which has a free connexion with the open sea and within which sea water is measurably diluted with fresh water derived from land drainage '' [2]. Within the broadest interpretation of this definition, the whole Arctic Ocean can be considered an estuary with outflows at Fram Strait and through the Canadian Archipelago. The total freshwater inflow of over 3300 km3 yr-1 [3, 4] plus an additional 900 km3 yr-1 of net precipitation produces a grand Arctic Ocean estuary exceeded only by the Amazon estuary (6300 km3 yr-1). A more traditional view of an estuary is that it comprises a near-shore, low-salinity zone surrounding the mouth of a river. However, a definition that includes only river runoff as it meets the sea is wholly inadequate to describe arctic estuaries in the context of global change and freshwater budget. As will be shown here, arctic estuaries must be viewed at the scale of the shelf to understand their role in the Arctic Ocean's freshwater balance and circulation and how estuaries will respond to change through feedback. Similarly, but on a larger scale, the Arctic Ocean estuary at Fram Strait influences freshwater balance and thermohaline circulation of the global ocean [3].},

This study investigated the effects of selective withdrawal on hydrodynamics of a stratified reservoir through numerical modeling and analytical analysis. A 3-D hydrodynamic model was applied where observations of water temperature time series recorded every 30 min at the thermocline and measured temperature profiles along the water column were used to validate the numerical model. The effect of selective withdrawal from four outlets located along the water intake structure of Tahtali Reservoir in Turkey on water temperatures was investigated and the effects on thermal stratification structure were discussed. Withdrawal of the water at the bottom outlet was found to be the most effective choice encouraging the mixing of the water column and thus reducing anoxia. The results of this study can be used to guide the further investigations in stratified lakes for better management practices.},

	Abstract = {Modulation over the spring-neap cycle of the frictional forces in a constricted (choked) channel connecting a lagoon to the open sea can induce a fortnightly-period rise and fall of sea level in the lagoon. A similar effect is also observed in the upper reaches of tidal rivers. Intuitively it might be expected that the fortnightly lagoon tide would be exactly in phase with the open-sea spring-neap cycle, with maximum frictional set-up of lagoon sea-levels at springs. A nonlinear model is used to demonstrate that this need not be the case, however, and that the fortnightly lagoon tide can lag the open-sea spring-neap cycle by up to 3 days. The model is supported by observations from an artificial lagoon in North Wales, which is subject to two widely differing choking regimes as a result of the opening or closing of one inlet by a sluice gate.},

@article{hollibaugh_arsenic_2005,
	Abstract = {Mono Lake is a closed-basin, alkaline, hypersaline lake located at the western edge of the Great Basin in eastern California. We studied the distribution of arsenic (As) species in the water column of Mono Lake between February and November, 2002. This period captured the seasonal progression from winter mixing, through summer thermal stratification, to autumn overturn. Arsenic speciation was determined by ion chromatography-inductively coupled-plasma-mass spectrometry of samples preserved in the field by flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. We found that arsenic speciation was dominated (\&gt;90\%) by arsenate when oxygen was detectable. Once levels fell below 6 μmol/L O2, arsenic speciation shifted to dominance by reduced species. Arsenate and arsenite co-occurred in a transition zone immediately below the base of the oxycline and low but significant concentrations of arsenate were occasionally detected in sulfidic hypolimnion samples. Thio-arsenic species were the dominant form of As found in sulfidic waters. Maxima of thio-arsenic species with stoichiometries consistent with mono-, di- and trithio-arsenic occurred in succession as sulfide concentration increased. A compound with a stoichiometry consistent with trithio-arsenic was the dominant As species (∼50\% of total As) in high sulfide (2 mmol/L) bottom water. Lower concentrations of total As in bottom water relative to surface water suggest precipitation of As/S mineral phases in response to sulfide accumulation during prolonged anoxia.},

@article{oliveira_effect_2006,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of natural and artificial morphological changes in a tidal inlet on the tidal propagation and on the water exchanges with the sea, through data analysis and numerical modeling. Bathymetric and tidal data reveal a strong seasonal signal, as a result of the changes in the relative importance of tidal and wave action: during the maritime winter the M2 tidal amplitude decreases by 50\% and flood dominance increases. This trend is reverted during maritime summer, and tidal amplitudes can be further enhanced by dredging of the inlet.

Hydrodynamic and residence time ({RT}) simulations were set up for three different bathymetric configurations of the lower lagoon, representative of distinct situations. Hydrodynamic results confirmed that tidal propagation depends strongly on the bathymetric configuration. At the transitions between channels, tidal energy losses occur and flood dominance increases. Dredging the channels and repositioning the inlet throat improve tidal propagation and promote sediment flushing to the sea.

The spatial variability of {RTs} was evaluated through the integration of individual particle results in morphologically relevant units, while time variability was examined within the tidal and neap/spring cycles. Residence times depend heavily on the morphological changes associated with both dredging operations and inlet migration, and on the particle release time, both within the tidal cycle and within neap/spring cycles. The relative importance of each of these factors depends on the particle location within the lagoon. The upstream regions of the lagoon have very large {RTs} (years), as a result of the small tidal amplitudes and velocities. In some of these regions, {RTs} vary by a factor of 4 depending on the bathymetry of the inlet. In the lower lagoon, tidal amplitude also has a significant effect on {RTs}. Dredging the channels and repositioning the inlet throat from the southern margin to a central position improves the flushing of both southern and northern channels.},

@article{riddin_effect_2010,
	Abstract = {Temporarily open/closed estuaries typically open to the sea due to freshwater inflow coupled with storm surge events. In September 2008, in the absence of freshwater inflow, the mouth of the East Kleinemonde Estuary breached in response to a storm surge. The mouth of the estuary closed the following day at a high level. Marine overwash events following the breach introduced large volumes of saline water into the estuary and raised the water level by 0.07{\^a}€``0.33\&\#xa0;m. Salinity was significantly higher in the 15 month closed phase after the breach (31\&\#xa0;{\^A}$\pm$\&\#xa0;0.9) compared to 21.9\&\#xa0;{\^A}$\pm$\&\#xa0;0.9 in the closed brackish phase before the breach. The historical average salinity for the estuary during a closed period is 23{\^a}€``25. The increase in salinity has reduced submerged macrophytes Ruppia cirrhosa and Chara vulgaris cover by 38.1\%. Macroalgal cover of species such as Dictyota dichotoma, Caulacanthus ustulatus, Codium tenue and Ulva spp. have increased by 7.9\%. The saline high water levels have also significantly reduced supratidal salt marsh cover by 15.2\%, and reed and sedge cover by 19.7\%. Loss of these habitats may result in bank destabilisation and erosion. This is the first record of an extended saline period in the 15 years the estuary has been monitored. Sea level rise in association with climate change, together with localised freshwater inflow reduction is likely to result in an increase in marine overwash events. The frequency and duration of closed saline periods are likely to increase in this type of estuary. A loss of submerged macrophytes may have significant impacts on faunal composition and abundance and on the subsequent functioning of temporarily open/closed estuaries. This has serious ecological implications since these estuaries represent 70\% of the different types of estuaries found in South Africa.},

@article{backhaus_simulating_2008,
	Abstract = {The interaction of seagrasses with the dynamics of an oscillatory wave induced flow is assessed with a new Lagrangian plant model. The plant model simulates moving plants in canopies and their dissipative effect on the ambient flow. Concomitantly the plant model is interactively coupled to a 3D hydrodynamic numerical model allowing for a bilateral feedback between moving plants and flow. Model results demonstrate that this interaction causes a modification of current profiles within and above a canopy as compared to an undisturbed flow. While the overall effect of submerged plant canopies is a dampening of dynamics, the flow may locally be intensified. The model predicted an intensification of the flow near the top of a canopy in concurrence with field and laboratory observations. Dissipation in the coupled model, due to the applied non-linear friction law, grows exponentially with increasing flow. As a result the permeability of a canopy to the ambient flow decreases with increasing dissipation. Consequently, at high flow velocities, while becoming increasingly impermeable, a canopy acts like an obstacle that deflects the flow above it, which causes the observed intensification. Results for canopies consisting of seagrasses with different leaf structure and plant geometry show remarkable differences in predicted plant motions, current profiles, drag forces, and velocity shear. Predictions for moving plants are compared with those for rigid, less flexible, structures and undisturbed flow.},

	Abstract = {State geoscientists (geologists, geophysicists, seismologists, and engineers) in California work closely with federal, state and local government emergency managers to help prepare coastal communities for potential impacts from a tsunami before, during, and after an event. For teletsunamis, as scientific information (forecast model wave heights, first-wave arrival times, etc.) from {NOAA}'s West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center is made available, federal- and state-level emergency managers must help convey this information in a concise, comprehensible and timely manner to local officials who ultimately determine the appropriate response activities for their jurisdictions. During the September 29, 2009 Tsunami Advisory for California, government geoscientists assisted the California Emergency Management Agency by providing technical assistance during teleconference meetings with {NOAA} and other state and local emergency managers prior to the arrival of the tsunami. This technical assistance included background information on anticipated tidal conditions when the tsunami was set to arrive, wave height estimates from state-modeled scenarios for areas not covered by {NOAA}'s forecast models, and clarifying which regions of the state were at greatest risk. Over the last year, state geoscientists have started to provide additional assistance: 1) working closely with {NOAA} to simplify their tsunami alert messaging and expand their forecast modeling coverage; 2) creating ``playbooks'' containing information from existing tsunami scenarios for local emergency managers to reference during an event; and, 3) developing a state-level information ``clearinghouse'' and pre-tsunami field response team to assist local officials as well as observe and report tsunami effects. Activities of geoscientists were expanded during the more recent Tsunami Advisory on February 27, 2010, including deploying a geologist from the California Geological Survey as a field observer who provided information back to emergency managers.},

	Abstract = {The internal dynamics of Clear Lake, California---a large, multibasin and polymictic lake---under stratified conditions is described in this work. Particular attention is paid to one of the subbasins of Clear Lake (Oaks Arm). Several field experiments were conducted in the lake to obtain data of wind, currents, and water temperature using a wide range of devices. Based on field observations and previously published results on basin responses to wind stress, a conceptual model of the internal circulation of the Oaks Arm is proposed. Its internal dynamics are characterized by diurnal cycles of setup and relaxation of horizontal temperature gradients driven by the wind forcing. The setup and relaxation processes are modulated by the influence of the earth's rotation and create a residual cyclonic circulation. This circulation mechanism is here referred to as baroclinic pumping. It is in all likelihood not exclusive to Clear Lake but probably exists in other large and relatively shallow lakes forced by strong and almost periodic wind events where basin-scale internal waves do not play a major role in the dynamics of the system.},

@article{kjerfve_geographic_1989,
	Abstract = {Coastal lagoons can be conveniently separated based on geomorphology into leaky, restricted or choked systems. This subdivision orders coastal lagoons hydrodynamically according to water exchange with the coastal ocean. Leaky systems have the shortest turnover time, restricted lagoons have a longer turnover time, and choked lagoons have the longest turnover time. In leaky coastal lagoons, oscillating tidal currents account for most of the flow variance and mask residual currents due to wind- and freshwater-induced density gradients. In restricted lagoons, tides, winds, and freshwater runoff drive components of the circulation. Winds are usually dominant in causing circulation and mixing in choked lagoons, and water exchange with the coastal ocean largely depends on the hydrologic cycle. Coastal lagoons are usually well mixed, but can exhibit significant horizontal gradients due to freshwater runoff and vertical gradients due to solar radiation or surface cooling. In general, river inflow and heat balance induce stratification in coastal lagoons, whereas winds and tides cause mixing. Coastal lagoons usually trap inorganic sediment and organic matter, thus serving as material sinks. On a geologic time scale, they are short-lived landscape features, with an existence intrinsically linked to filtering efficiency and relative sea-level change as a result of glacioeustatic cycles and local tectonic activity.},

An example of this phenomenon   from the Pacific Northwest is predation by locally abundant pinnipeds (   seals and sea lions) on threatened, endangered, or otherwise depleted   salmonid ( Oncorhynchus spp.) populations. We used survey sampling   methodology, acoustic telemetry, and molecular genetics to quantify the   amount of harbor seal ( Phoca vitulina) predation on a depressed run of   coho salmon ( O. kisutch) and to determine whether some seals consumed a   disproportionately higher number of salmonids than others. Based on a   probability sample totaling 759.5 h of observation, we estimated that   seals consumed 1161 adult salmonids ( 95\% {CI} = 503 - 1818 salmonids)   during daylight hours over an 18.9- km estuarine study area in Oregon   during an 84- d period in fall 2002. Simultaneous tracking of 56 seals   via an acoustic telemetry array indicated that a small proportion of   marked seals ( 12.5\%) exhibited behavior that was consistent with   specialization on salmonids. These seals spent the majority of their   time in the riverine portion of the study area and did so   disproportionately more at night than day. Genetic analysis of 116   salmonid structures recovered from 11 seal fecal samples suggested that   coho salmon accounted for approximately one- half of total salmonid   consumption. Though subject to considerable uncertainty, the combined   results lead us to infer that seals consumed 21\% ( range 3 - 63\%) of the   estimated prespawning population of coho salmon. We speculate that the   majority of the predation occurred upriver, at night, and was done by a   relatively small proportion of the local seal population. Understanding   the extent and nature of pinniped predation can provide important inputs   into risk assessments and other modeling efforts designed to aid the   conservation and recovery of salmonids in the Pacific Northwest. Such   understanding may also help inform management actions designed to reduce   the impact of pinniped predation on salmonids, which potentially range   from shortterm lethal removal programs to long- term ecosystem   restoration and protection efforts.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of selective withdrawal through a point sink of horizontally unbounded, linearly stratified fluid of finite depth is studied as an initial-value problem. Following the initiation of discharge from the sink, internal gravity wave modes propagate radially upstream to change the flow pattern. These modes are called cylindrical modes. We first consider the case of F→0 (where F is the Froude number) to get linearized governing equations, and seek a linear asymptotic solution for large times t∗ after starting the discharge, of the cylindrical modes in a stratified fluid where viscous and diffusive effects are negligible. The obtained solution shows that the strength of the modal front grows like t∗1/3, unlike the case of two-dimensional modes whose strength at the front is kept constant. Numerical calculations are also performed to study the case of F{\textgreater}0. The results then indicate that all the cylindrical modes can propagate upstream for any F except infinity. The steady-state withdrawal-layer thickness and time to steady state are also investigated over the full parameter range considering the viscous and diffusive effects. The obtained results are then compared with both the analytical and experimental results of prior works. {\copyright} 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {Like other similar coastal systems, the Albufeira lagoon is artificially opened every year to promote water renewal and closes naturally within a few months. The evolution of the Albufeira Lagoon Inlet from its opening in April 2010 to its closure 8 months later is qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed through a combination of monthly field surveys and the application of a process-based morphodynamic model. Field data alone would not cover the whole space--time domain of the morphology of the inlet during its life time, whereas the morphodynamic model alone cannot reliably simulate the morphological development. Using a nudging technique introduced herein, this problem is overcome and a reliable and complete data set is generated for describing the morphological development of the tidal inlet. The new technique is shown to be a good alternative to extensive model calibration, as it can drastically improve the model performance. Results reveal that the lagoon imported sediments during its life span. However, the whole system (lagoon plus littoral barrier) actually lost sediments to the sea. This behavior is partly attributed to the modulation of tidal asymmetry by the spring--neap cycle, which reduces flood dominance on spring tides. Results also allowed the assessment of the relationship between the spring tidal prism and the cross-section of tidal inlets (the {PA} relationship). While this relationship is well established from empirical, theoretical and numerical evidences, its validity in inlets that are small or away from equilibrium was unclear. Results for the Albufeira lagoon reveal an excellent match between the new data and the empirical {PA} relationship derived for larger inlets and equilibrium conditions, supporting the validity of the relationship beyond its original scope.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
Temporarily open/closed estuaries ({TOCEs}) are systems temporarily closed off from the sea due to the development of a sandbar across the mouth during low rainfall periods. Due to their generally small size and overall higher retention times during the closed phase, these environments are highly susceptible to anthropogenic changes such as catchment degradation, climate change, pollution and changing river flow patterns. Several authors have reported marked fluctuations in biomass and density of biotic communities between the open and closed phases of specific estuaries. This study determines the responses of water column nutrients, plankton density and biomass to inlet phase changes of these systems, for which information was collated on dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, phytoplankton biomass, zooplankton density and biomass from 16 {TOCEs} in South Africa. Our analyses detected higher phytoplankton chlorophyll-a concentrations, zooplankton density and biomass during the closed phase of these estuaries. The analysis of temporal dynamics of five systems showed that plankton biomass can attain pre-breaching levels 10 days after mouth closure. Estimates showed that plankton standing stocks during the closed phase can be 26 to 10 000 times higher than during the open phase. Our findings have significant implications for the management and conservation of {TOCEs}, especially the regulation of freshwater inflow and artificial breaching of their mouths, and highlight the vulnerability of these systems to current and expected impacts of anthropogenic and climatic changes on their productivity and functioning.},

	Abstract = {Measurements of velocity and density profiles were made to describe the transverse structure of flow in Chacao Channel, Southern Chile (41.75$\,^{\circ}$S), where typical tidal velocities are ∼4 m/s. Current profiles were obtained with a 307.2 {kHz} Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler ({ADCP}) over 25 repetitions of a cross-channel transect during one semidiurnal tidal cycle. The 2.2 km long transect ran northeast/southwest across the channel. A northern channel (120 m deep) and a southern channel (85 m deep) were separated by Remolinos Rock, a pinnacle that rises to 20 m depth at ∼0.7 km from the southern side. Density measurements to depths of ∼50 m were obtained with a Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth ({CTD}) recorder at the north and south ends of each transect repetition. One {CTD} profile was also taken in the middle of the northern channel. The mean flow exhibited weak vertical structure because of strong vertical mixing. The predominant lateral structure consisted of mean outflow (toward the ocean) in the channels and mean inflow (toward Gulf of Ancud) over the pinnacle and the sides of the channel. This lateral structure pattern was consistent with the mean flow pattern expected from tidal rectification, as robust overtides were generated throughout the transect. The contributions to flow divergence and vorticity by the lateral variations of the lateral flow (∂v/∂y) and by the lateral shears of the along-channel flow (∂u/∂y), respectively, were both of the order of 10−3 s−1. This caused advective and frictional forces (both horizontal and vertical) to be dominant in the across-channel momentum balance, as they were more than twenty times the Coriolis acceleration. The present work then represents one of the few examples reported where lateral friction (proportional to ∂2v/∂y2) appears relevant to the transverse momentum balance.},

@article{luettich_jr._semi-diurnal_2002,
	Abstract = {Analysis of current meter data in the Neuse River Estuary ({NRE}) associates over half of the along channel velocity variance with roughly the semi-diurnal frequency band. Velocity in this frequency range is episodic, has a typical magnitude of 10\&\#xa0;cm\&\#xa0;s−1 and often reaches twice this speed. The {NRE} is a sub-estuary of the Albemarle--Pamlico Estuarine System ({APES}), which is the second largest estuarine complex and the largest lagoonal estuary in the United States. The astronomical tide in the {NRE} is negligible, owing to the {APES}'s virtual isolation from the coastal ocean by the North Carolina Outer Banks barrier island chain. The episodic nature of the velocity signal together with the lack of an astronomical tide suggest that the semi-diurnal signal in the {NRE} is generated within the {APES}/{NRE}, presumably due to meteorological forcing. In the absence of a tidal current, this motion plays a significant role in determining the position and strength of the salt wedge, the thickness of the diffusive bottom boundary layer and the overall dispersion characteristics of the system.

The episodic nature of the semi-diurnal signal encouraged us to pursue the use of nonstationary timeseries analysis techniques in the present study. We found wavelet analysis to be a highly effective technique for discriminating times when the semi-diurnal motion was strong and for identifying a predominant 13.2\&\#xa0;h period in the along channel component of both 10-week wintertime and 10-week summertime current meter records. Model runs using idealized wind forcing to excite the vertically integrated version of the {ADCIRC} finite element circulation model indicated that the {APES} has a natural mode oscillation period of 13.2\&\#xa0;h, an average ``seiche depth'' of 3.5\&\#xa0;m and a ``seiche length'' of 139\&\#xa0;km. This length is close to that of the long axis of Pamlico Sound, although the depth is approximately 25 percent less than the sound's 4.5\&\#xa0;m mean bathymetric depth. Model runs using observed winds from Cape Hatteras reproduced the seiching behavior of the system during both the wintertime and summertime observational periods. Seiche events appear to be excited by significant shifts in either the magnitude or direction of the wind field.},

	Abstract = {Estuarine turbulence is notable in that both the dissipation rate and the buoyancy frequency extend to much higher values than in other natural environments. The high dissipation rates lead to a distinct inertial subrange in the velocity and scalar spectra, which can be exploited for quantifying the turbulence quantities. However, high buoyancy frequencies lead to small Ozmidov scales, which require high sampling rates and small spatial aperture to resolve the turbulent fluxes. A set of observations in a highly stratified estuary demonstrate the effectiveness of a vessel-mounted turbulence array for resolving turbulent processes, and for relating the turbulence to the forcing by the Reynolds-averaged flow. The observations focus on the ebb, when most of the buoyancy flux occurs. Three stages of mixing are observed: (1) intermittent and localized but intense shear instability during the early ebb; (2) continuous and relatively homogeneous shear-induced mixing during the mid-ebb, and weakly stratified, boundary-layer mixing during the late ebb. The mixing efficiency as quantified by the flux Richardson number Rf was frequently observed to be higher than the canonical value of 0.15 from Osborn (J Phys Oceanogr 10:83--89, 1980). The high efficiency may be linked to the temporal--spatial evolution of shear instabilities.},

@article{maccready_estuarine_2007,
	Abstract = {Subtidal adjustment of estuarine salinity and circulation to changing river flow or tidal mixing is explored using a simplified numerical model. The model employs tidally averaged, width-averaged physics, following Hansen and Rattray, extended to include 1) time dependence, 2) tidally averaged mixing parameterizations, and 3) arbitrary variation of channel depth and width. By linearizing the volume-integrated salt budget, the time-dependent system may be distilled to a first-order, forced, damped, ordinary differential equation. From this equation, analytical expressions for the adjustment time and sensitivity of the length of the salt intrusion are developed. For estuaries in which the up-estuary salt flux is dominated by vertically segregated gravitational circulation, this adjustment time is predicted to be T-{ADJ} = (1/6) L/, where L is the length of the salt intrusion and u is the section-averaged velocity (i.e., that due to the river flow). The importance of the adjustment time becomes apparent when considering forcing time scales. Seasonal river-flow variation is much slower than typical adjustment times in systems such as the Hudson River estuary, and thus the response may be quasi steady. Spring-neap mixing variation, in contrast, has a period comparable to typical adjustment times, and so unsteady effects are more important. In this case, the stratification may change greatly while the salt intrusion is relatively unperturbed.},

	Abstract = {Dramatic changes have been observed in the Arctic over the last century. Many of these involve the storage and cycling of fresh water. On land, precipitation and river discharge, lake abundance and size, glacier area and volume, soil moisture, and a variety of permafrost characteristics have changed. In the ocean, sea ice thickness and areal coverage have decreased and water mass circulation patterns have shifted, changing freshwater pathways and sea ice cover dynamics. Precipitation onto the ocean surface has also changed. Such changes are expected to continue, and perhaps accelerate, in the coming century, enhanced by complex feedbacks between the oceanic, atmospheric, and terrestrial freshwater systems. Change to the arctic freshwater system heralds changes for our global physical and ecological environment as well as human activities in the Arctic. In this paper we review observed changes in the arctic freshwater system over the last century in terrestrial, atmospheric, and oceanic systems.},

	Abstract = {Estuarine morphology is to a large extent determined by the residual sediment transport pattern. However, the inverse statement is also true. Residual sediment transport depends on differences in magnitude and duration between ebb and flood tidal currents. Such differences (``tidal asymmetry'') are produced by the distortion of the tidal wave propagating on the coastal shelf and entering bays and estuaries. In this study the relationship between tidal asymmetry and estuarine morphology is investigated. Based on theoretical considerations some general principles are derived and compared with field observations.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes tidal and subtidal motion in the Barnegat Bay---Little Egg Harbor estuarine system. This description is based on analysis of current meter and sea level observations made in this shallow multiple-inlet-bay system. Results indicate that tidal period motion is strongly attenuated and that tidal phase propagation is appreciably slowed by bottom stress. Subtidal motion is characterized based on Complex Empirical Orthogonal Function ({CEOF}) analysis. The first {CEOF} mode, which contains over 70\% of the variance, is driven by coastal sea level and is characterized by coastal pumping with a simultaneous inflow/outflow through the inlets. This mode dominates subtidal motion at all current meter moorings, including those in the bay's interior. The second mode, which contains only 20\% of the variance, is driven by local winds and is characterized by a through-flow, whereby flow enters an upwind inlet while exiting a downwind inlet. Results also indicate that Little Egg Harbor, because of its wide inlet, is more responsive to both tidal and subtidal motion than is Barnegat Bay. This differential response appears to drive a subtidal advective exchange between these waters.},

@article{shetye_role_1992,
	Abstract = {Shallow estuaries often show tidal asymmetry of flood-dominance in which duration of the flood is shorter and its peak discharge larger than the corresponding values during ebb. Here we propose a simple analytic model for this phenomenon. Noting that in tidal propagation in shallow, narrow estuaries, the dominant terms in the momentum balance are pressure gradient and friction, we preserve only these two terms in the model and linearize the friction. The resulting governing equation for tidal propagation is a diffusion equation with the diffusion coefficient a function of the area and the wetted perimeter of the channel cross-section. The nature of variation of both the area and the perimeter with tidal height depends on the channel geometry, and for most channels the former is more important. Solutions, derived using a perturbation expansion scheme for channels with simple geometries, show that the variation of the diffusion coefficient over a tidal cycle leads to flood-dominance. This and other characteristics of the solution compare favourably with the features seen in observations.},

@article{nepf_flow_2000,
	Abstract = {Aquatic vegetation controls the mean and turbulent flow structure in channels and coastal regions and thus impacts the fate and transport of sediment and contaminants. Experiments in an open-channel flume with model vegetation were used to better understand how vegetation impacts flow. In particular, this study describes the transition between submerged and emergent regimes based on three aspects of canopy flow: mean momentum, turbulence, and exchange dynamics. The observations suggest that flow within an aquatic canopy may be divided into two regions. In the upper canopy, called the ``vertical exchange zone'', vertical turbulent exchange with the overlying water is dynamically significant to the momentum balance and turbulence; and turbulence produced by mean shear at the top of the canopy is important. The lower canopy is called the ``longitudinal exchange zone'' because it communicates with surrounding water predominantly through longitudinal advection. In this region turbulence is generated locally by the canopy elements, and the momentum budget is a simple balance of vegetative drag and pressure gradient. In emergent canopies, only a longitudinal exchange zone is present. When the canopy becomes submerged, a vertical exchange zone appears at the top of the canopy and deepens into the canopy as the depth of submergence increases.},

	Abstract = {The spatiotemporal structure of wind-driven circulation patterns and associated water exchanges or residence times can drive important bio-hydrodynamic interactions in shallow lakes and estuaries. The St Lucia estuarine lake in South Africa is an example of such a system. It is a {UNESCO} World Heritage Site and {RAMSAR} wetland of international importance but no detailed research on its circulation patterns has previously been undertaken. In this study, a hydrodynamic model was used to investigate the structure of these circulations to provide insights into their role in transport and water exchange processes. A strong diurnal temporal pattern of wind speeds, together with directional switching between two dominant directions, drives intermittent water exchanges and mixing between the lake basins. Nearshore high speed flows in shallow areas and counter-flows in deeper areas, linked by circulatory gyres, are key features of the circulation. These patterns are strongly influenced by the complex geometry of St Lucia and constrictions in the system. Water exchange time scales are non-homogeneous with some basin extremities having relatively long residence times. The influence of the circulation patterns on biological processes are discussed.},

Here, we present measurements of profiles of the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (ɛ), from which vertical mixing is inferred, for several locations in the summer stratified zones of the {NW} European shelf seas. At both sites we find significant thermocline mixing, with ∼20\% of the observed turbulent dissipation taking place within the thermocline. We then present evidence to demonstrate that the thermocline mixing is a result of shear instability within the thermocline. This is contrary to the conventional view that vertical mixing in shelf seas is largely driven by boundary shear stresses.},

The estuary mouth closed in June 2002 and has remained so for more than two-and-a-half years. A lack of information on biotic responses during extended closed-mouth conditions prompted a study to ascertain the current status of the fish fauna in the system. Fish were sampled with seine and gill-nets at six sites spread throughout the system. At the time of sampling in December 2004, the system had become partitioned into four isolated compartments. A total of 4 475 fish comprising 30 species were recorded during the survey. The {CPUEs} were generally low, except for those of Oreochromis mossambicus, Liza dumerili and Ambassis ambassis. The freshwater cichlid O. mossambicus made up 45\% of the total catch. The species composition in each of the four compartments of the system were very different. Historical data indicated a loss of about 40\% of the commonly-occurring species from the lake since mouth closure, reflecting a substantial change in species composition from that which occurs under 'normal' conditions. It is expected that the decline in the number of species and the abundance of remaining taxa will continue if drought conditions persist and the mouth remains closed.

	Abstract = {The ichthyofauna of the intermittently open Shellharbour Lagoon in southeastern Australia was sampled over 14 months to investigate factors influencing species composition. Zostera capricorni and bare sand habitats were sampled every two months with a fine-mesh seine. Of the 10\&\#xa0;277 fish caught representing 19 families and 27 species, the most numerically dominant species were Pseudogobius olorum and Pseudomugil signifer. The most abundant economically important species were Acanthopagrus australis, Mugil cephalus and Myxus elongatus. Mean number of fish and species was significantly higher over Zostera than bare sand during months immediately after the estuary opened when juvenile marine fishes recruited, demonstrating the estuary's nursery function. In contrast to other intermittently open estuaries in Australia and South Africa, Shellharbour Lagoon's fish assemblage appears resilient to perturbation and does not undergo distinct seasonal variations. This may be a result of the estuary's short open phases providing less opportunity for marine fishes to enter. Perhaps more importantly, the less dramatic fluctuations in salinity between open and closed phases maintains salinity at a level intermediate of the tolerances of both marine and estuarine fishes.},

@article{ranasinghe_circulation_1999,
	Abstract = {Tidal inlets in microtidal, wave-dominated coastal environments tend to close to the ocean seasonally. This obstructs navigation and could cause degradation of water quality in the estuary/lagoon connected to the inlet. Hence, engineering solutions are often implemented to prevent inlet closure. However, a prior knowledge of circulation and mixing processes within the estuary is crucial for the sustainability of any engineering solution. This paper attempts to provide insight into circulation and mixing characteristics of seasonally open estuaries based on the results of a field study undertaken at Wilson Inlet, a typical seasonally open estuary, in south-western Australia. Results of the study indicate that this type of estuary may have two distinct behavioural patterns, in winter and in summer. During winter, solar heating causes density stratification during daytime, and convective cooling causes overnight de-stratification; a horizontal cyclonic gyre is established during winter by the combined action of the Coriolis force and streamflow. During summer, strong sea breezes ({\textasciitilde}10 m s$^{\textrm{\&\#8211;1}}$ ) cause vertical mixing during daytime, and convective cooling vertically mixes the water column at night. When the inlet is open, sea water propagates into the estuary during flooding tides unless streamflows are very high.},

@article{moreno_morphodynamics_2010-1,
	Abstract = {Coastal lagoons are valuable water bodies since they are of great ecological and economic interest throughout the world. Their existence is controlled by variations in sea level and the geological substrate of their location. Their morphology is linked to local topography, alternation of high and low pressure, the presence of a river, as well as tidal regime. All these factors influence lagoons along the coastline in the south of Spain. The main morphological characteristics of such lagoons are the following: intermittence, one-dimensional morphology, small size, shallow waters, high area/depth ratio, no flood- or ebb tide deltas, overwash of their low barriers during storms, high evaporation rates and feeding by rivers.

Effective management of these systems requires the evaluation not only of their hydrodynamics and opening and closure rate, but also the prediction of possible future scenarios as a response to meteorological events. This paper describes the behavior of a coastal lagoon in Zahara de los Atunes (C{\'a}diz) by means of a numerical model implemented with the objective of serving as a tool for optimizing the coastal zone management.

Although the coastal lagoon at Zahara de los Atunes is closed most of the year, it is artificially opened at the beginning of the summer. The results of our study showed that during this period, the lagoon is flood-dominated with a pumping-mode response. It naturally tends to close since it is a trap for littoral drift sediments. The precise date of closure depends on the events that take place during the autumn, which determine whether the sediments deposited in the inlet by the littoral drift are flushed out by the river flow or flushed in by the waves.},

@article{alebregtse_effect_2014,
	Abstract = {Non-linear tidal dynamics are investigated in a network that consists of a semi-enclosed main channel and a secondary channel at an arbitrary position. The water motion, governed by the one-dimensional shallow water equations, is forced by an incoming tidal wave. Solutions are obtained with the method of characteristics. The overall aim is to quantify and understand the spatial structure of different tidal harmonics (the principal tide and its non-linear overtides) and of tidal asymmetry for both the vertical and the horizontal tide in the main channel for different locations of the secondary channel. This is of practical interest in the context of possible construction of secondary channels to reduce tidal range in estuaries. Moreover, tidal asymmetry is an important factor in driving net sediment transport. Analysis of the different tidal harmonics shows that their characteristics are similar to those obtained with an earlier linear model. In particular, amplitudes of the harmonics are reduced landward of the secondary channel if the latter is positioned less than a quarter wavelength of the respective tidal wave away from the landward boundary. Thus, the distortions of the tide due to the presence of the secondary channel are generated locally and afterwards propagate through the network. Tidal asymmetry is quantified by examining tidal range, flood-to-ebb ratio and the duration of the falling tide and the duration between maximum flood and maximum ebb. A spatial non-uniform reduction in tidal range is observed that shows very localised increase and decrease depending on the position of the secondary channel. The changes in the velocity characteristics induce changes in net sediment transport. It turns out that the direction of the peak current, derived from the flood-to-ebb ratio, is not sensitive to the position of the secondary channel, whereas the duration between flood and ebb can change from more to less than half the tidal cycle. However, the changes in the velocity asymmetries are confined to a small region.},

@article{nepf_flow_2012,
	Abstract = {This review describes mean and turbulent flow and mass transport in the presence of aquatic vegetation. Within emergent canopies, the turbulent length scales are set by the stem diameter and spacing, and the mean flow is determined by the distribution of the canopy frontal area. Near sparse submerged canopies, the bed roughness and near-bed turbulence are enhanced, but the velocity profile remains logarithmic. For dense submerged canopies, the drag discontinuity at the top of the canopy generates a shear layer, which contains canopy-scale vortices that control the exchange of mass and momentum between the canopy and the overflow. The canopy-scale vortices penetrate a finite distance into the canopy, δe, set by the canopy drag. This length scale segregates the canopy into two regions: The upper canopy experiences energetic turbulent transport, controlled by canopy-scale vortices, whereas the lower canopy experiences diminished transport, associated with the smaller stem-scale turbulence. The canopy-scale vortices induce a waving motion in flexible blades, called a monami.},

@incollection{bowen_observations_????,
	Abstract = {Near-bottom pressure and velocity, measured along a cross-shore transect extending from the shore to about 8-m water depth on a barred beach, are used to study the cross-shore propagation of surf beat and the associated cross-shore flux of surf beat energy. The dominant Empirical Orthogonal Functions ({EOF}'s) of pressure fluctuations measured in less than 5 m depth at relatively low beat frequencies (0.005--0.025 Hz) had well developed nodes and antinodes, with $\pm$π phase jumps at the nodes, suggestive of standing wave motions. The dominant {EOF}'s of relatively high frequency surf beat (0.03--0.05 Hz) showed some nodal structure, but their phase increased approximately linearly with distance from the shore indicating net shoreward propagation. {EOF}'s of combined pressure and cross-shore velocity fluctuations at beat frequencies showed a similar mixture of standing and progressive waves. Furthermore, phases between pressure and velocity components were close to $\pm$π/2 at relatively low beat frequencies ({\textless} 0.25 Hz), as predicted by standing waves theories, but at higher beat frequencies (0.3--0.05 Hz) phases usually had magnitudes less than π/2, but significantly greater than zero, suggestive of mixed standing and shoreward progressive waves. Shoreward propagating surf beat carried a shoreward energy flux. During a storm, this shoreward flux was about half the flux that could have been carried if all surf beat propagated directly shorewards. The energy carried shoreward by propagating surf beat was lost either at the shoreface (for moderate waves) or on the offshore side of the bar (during a storm). On one occasion surf beat carried energy seawards outside the surf zone and shorewards inside the surf zone, consistent with theoretical models that predict surf beat forcing at the outer edge of the surf zone.},

@article{bagarinao_sulfide_1992,
	Abstract = {This review brings together a large number of independent and seemingly unrelated studies in various disciplines under four major topics: (1) sulfide as an environmental factor in aquatic habitats; (2) sulfide as a toxicant; (3) sulfide tolerance of aquatic organisms; and (4) adaptations limiting sulfide toxicity. Sulfide is widely distributed in the aquatic environment, but has been largely overlooked as an environmental factor for aquatic organisms. Sulfide at nanomoiar to millimolar concentrations adversely affects cytochrome c oxidase, various other enzymes, oxygen transport proteins, cellular structures, and consequently the physiological functions of organisms. These toxic effects are well documented in the biomedical literature, and also occur in the aquatic organisms that have been studied. Sulfide tolerance varies widely among protozoans, sediment meiofauna, polychaetes, bivalves, crustaceans, marine and freshwater fishes, and aquatic plants, often in correlation with the relative sulfide levels in the respective habitats. Aquatic organisms have evolved various adaptations against sulfide toxicity, possibly several acting in concert. Most animals are able to avoid and escape from sulfide, but cannot exclude sulfide from the body. No sulfide-resistant cytochrome c oxidase has been demonstrated, and most animals are capable of some degree of anaerobic meabolism. Various invertebrates have entered into symbiotic associations with sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. Some of these invertebrates immobilize and transport sulfide by means of sulfide-binding proteins or persulfides in the blood. Detoxication of sulfide occurs by methylation, non-specific oxidation, and enzymatic oxidation by mitochondria. Oxidative detoxication of sulfide to thiosulfate by mitochondria is common to several major taxa (protozoan, mollusk, teleosts, mammal), and is effective at low micromolar sulfide concentrations. Among organisms lacking sulfide-oxidizing bacterial symbionts, the mitochondria may thus provide the chief defense against environmental sulfide, and may allow the whole organism to tolerate sulfide concentrations 2-3 orders of magnitude greater than would inhibit cytochrome c oxidase.},

The progradation of the shores of the Galion Bay (Martinique) has been measured based on diachronic mapping analysis. The sedimentary volume which accumulates along the coast and in the bay (under the water surface) is unknown. Erodibility has been surveyed on a square meter scale and extrapolated to the watersheds. The results show that most sediments originate from the farmed surfaces, they are then entrained by the runoff and the Galion river and deposited along the coast, where the bathymetry and currentology of the bay facilitate sediment retention.

@article{imberger_flux_1998,
	Abstract = {This review focuses on clarifying the energy transfer mechanisms operating in a stratified lake. The energy imparted by the wind to the lake leads to basin scale waves which may be identified as Kelvin or Poincar{\'e} waves or simple gravitational seiching; the vertical model structure of these waves appears to depend on the wind forcing and the basin slope, but most of the energy resides in the first and second modes. Once established these basin scale waves steepen due to non-linear processes and due to shoaling forming a spectrum of internal wave motions within the metalimnion with frequencies from about 10−6 Hz to 10−2 Hz depending on the size of the lake and the severity of the stratification. The waves at the high frequency end of the spectrum are often highly non-linear and are best described as solitary waves, bores and hydraulic jumps.It is shown that waves in the frequency range from 5 times 10−5 to 10−2 Hz are close to critical with respect to typical bottom slopes. A review of internal wave reflection showed that for such incident waves most of the incident internal wave energy is dissipated at the boundary. This is also true for isolated solitary waves. There are thus two energy sources for the maintenance of the benthic boundary layer. First, at the level of the metalimnion incident internal wave modes break giving up their energy, and second, the velocity field associated with the first mode heaving leads to shear production at the lake bottom in the deeper parts of a lake basin.Recent evidence also suggests that the composite internal wave field gives rise to turbulent patches in the metalimnion and to a lesser extent in the hypolimnion. The great majority of the turbulent events have very small displacement scales and are thus inefficient at transporting mass vertically, even though the mean dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy may be as high as 10−8 m2 s−3.It appears that mass is thus transferred vertically in two ways in a stratified lake. First, through the benthic boundary layer, and second, to a much lesser extent directly by intermittent turbulent mixing.},

@article{castelle_dynamics_2007,
	Abstract = {Currumbin Creek on the Australian Gold Coast is a wave-dominated tidal inlet which exhibits a particularly active morphology. The recent history of Currumbin Creek entrance has seen rapid growth of the entrance for access to the ocean by fishermen, as a world class surfing site, and as a recreational area. Before the construction of two groynes in the 70's, Currumbin Creek entrance was highly variable in terms of inlet location and sand bar characteristics due to a cyclical behaviour of spit migration. Nowadays, the entrance is stabilised. However, natural processes continue with the entrance infilling causing flood and navigation issues, resulting in a regular dredging program to maintain an open entrance and for regular beach nourishment plans.
This paper investigates the behaviour of the entrance and adjacent beaches from aerial photographs and numerical modelling. Before groyne construction, sand by-passing was intense resulting in channel migration and sometimes the closure of the mouth. After training works, the longshore drift is diverted further north from the mouth leading to new circulation patterns behind the headland. During fair weather conditions, the sand transported by the longshore current is trapped by Currumbin rock groyne resulting in a negative sediment budget in Palm Beach. For high energy conditions, the diverted longshore current splits in the southern Palm Beach, resulting in a circulation cell. The sediment of the southern beaches is stirred up and transported both northward and toward the inlet.},

	Note = {The physico-chemical and hydrological characteristics of two intermittently opening coastal lagoons on the mid south coast of New South Wales were studied and compared with those of a permanently open coastal lagoon in the same area. Aspects studied over a period of several years during the mid to late 1980's included seasonal patterns of catchment rainfall, fluctuations in salinity and water temperature, and the opening regimes of these lagoons to the sea. The two intermittently opening lagoons (Swan Lake and Lake Wollumboola) were found to open for durations of around one to five months at approximately two-yearly intervals over the study period. Their salinity regimes fluctuated over this period in response to a complex of factors including rainfall and catchment runoff, temperature and surface evaporation, and the morphology of their entrance channels and duration of their opening to, and thus, the amount of water exchange with, the sea. These physical, chemical and hydrological characteristics are compared and contrasted with those of the permanently open lagoon (Lake Conjola), and also those of similar intermittently opening lagoons in other areas of the Indo-Pacific region (including south-western Australia, southern Africa and eastern Mexico). The above findings, and particularly those relating to lagoon opening regimes and salinity fluctuations, will be discussed in relation to both the community structure of fish assemblages and fisheries in these two types of lagoons, and juvenile fish recruitment to them and adult fish movements into and out of them, in subsequent papers describing the ecology of fishes in these systems.},

@article{dunton_food_2012,
	Abstract = {The eastern Alaska Beaufort Sea coast is characterized by numerous shallow (2--5 m) estuarine lagoons, fed by streams and small rivers that drain northward from the Brooks Range through the arctic coastal plain, and bounded seaward by barrier islands and shoals. Millions of birds from six continents nest and forage during the summer period in this region using the river deltas, lagoons, and shoreline along with several species of anadromous and marine fish. We examined biogeochemical processes linking the benthic community to the overall food web structure of these poorly studied but pristine estuaries, which are largely covered by 1.8 m of ice for 10 months annually. In summer, these lagoons are relatively warm with brackish salinities (5--10$\,^{\circ}$C, S = 10--25) compared to more open coastal waters (0--5$\,^{\circ}$C, S {\textgreater} 27). The stable isotopic composition of organic materials in sediments (i.e., benthic particulate organic matter) and water column suspended particulate organic matter from both streams and lagoons are largely indistinguishable and reflect strong terrestrial contributions, based upon δ13C and δ15N values (−25.6‰ to −27.4‰ and 1.4‰ to 3.3‰, respectively). By comparison, shifts toward more heavy isotope-enriched organic materials reflecting marine influence are observed on the adjacent coastal shelf (−24.8‰ to −25.4‰ and 3.4‰ to 5.3‰, respectively). The isotopic composition of lagoon fauna is consistent with a food web dominated by omnivorous detritovores strongly dependent on microbial processing of terrestrial sources of carbon. Biomagnification of 15N in benthic organisms indicate that the benthic food web in lagoons support up to four trophic levels, with carnivorous gastropod predators and benthic fishes (δ15N values up to 14.4‰) at the apex.},

Monthly seining collections were made for a year at nine stations, each covering 200 m, along a 6 km total reach from extreme headwaters to near the confluence with a larger stream. In both riffle and pool habitat types, assemblage composition was related to water depth and substratum size and thus to longitudinal position in the stream. However, the commonly described longitudinal pattern of downstream increase in species richness and abundance was reflected better in assemblages of pools than of riffles. Temporal patterns were related to changes in species richness and fish abundance, especially of juveniles. Unlike pools, most of the variance in riffle assemblage structure was temporal. Riffles may be supplemental habitats or refuges for juveniles of taxa found primarily in pools, whereas pools serve as refuges during drought or floods for taxa found primarily in riffles.},

@article{pattiaratchi_tide_2009,
	Abstract = {Tide gauge data collected from Sri Lanka (three stations) and Western Australia (eleven stations) during the Indian Ocean tsunamis, which occurred in December 2004, March 2005, July 2006, and September 2007, and incorporated five tsunamis, were examined to determine tsunami behaviour during these events. During the December 2004 tsunami, maximum wave heights of 3.87 m and 1.75 m were recorded at Colombo (Sri Lanka) and Bunbury (Western Australia), respectively. The results indicated that although the relative magnitudes of the tsunamis varied, the tsunami behaviour at each station was similar. This was due to the effect of the local and regional topography. At all tide gauges, the spectral energy corresponding to periods between 20 and 85 minutes increased during the tsunami. The sea-level data obtained from the west and south coasts of Sri Lanka (Colombo and Kirinda) indicated the importance of wave reflections from the Maldives Island chain, which produced the maximum wave two to three hours after the arrival of the first wave. In contrast, Trincomalee on the east coast did not show evidence of a reflected wave. Similarly, along the west coast of Australia, the highest waves occurred 15 hours after the arrival of the first wave. Here, based on travel times, we postulated that the waves were reflected from the Mascarene Ridge and/or the Island of Madagascar. Reflected waves were not present in the 2006 tsunami, where the primary waves propagated away from topographic features. One of the main influences of the tsunami was to set up oscillations at the local resonance frequency. Because Sri Lanka and Western Australia have relatively straight coastlines, these oscillations were related to the fundamental period of the shelf oscillation. For Colombo, this corresponded to 75-minute period, whereas in Geraldton and Busselton (Australia), the four-hour period was most prominent; at Jurien Bay and Fremantle, the resonance period was 2.7 hours.},

@article{perry_biofilm-related_1999,
	Abstract = {Micrite envelopes are a common feature in carbonate sediments and are typically associated with the micrite filling of borings produced by microendolithic organisms. These are referred to as `destructive micrite envelopes' and have long been recognized as reflecting an important early diagenetic process. Recent analysis of sediments collected from back-reef environments at Discovery Bay, north Jamaica, however, has demonstrated `envelope' formation on the surfaces of carbonate grains, clearly distinct from the micrite filling of microborings. Such constructive envelopes occur almost exclusively in sediments from grass-bed environments and are always intimately associated with `biofilms' comprising abundant mucilage, cyanobacteria, bacteria and diatoms. It is suggested that these envelopes represent a product of both biologically mediated micrite precipitation (occurring within the biofilm mucilage and around the biofilm components, i.e. cyanobacteria and diatoms) and associated trapping of carbonate mud and fine-grained sediment. Their recognition only within grass-bed sediments may enable their use as a diagnostic feature of grass-bed environments or vegetation-stabilized substrates in the rock record.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}An attempt is made to synthesize the geological properties, water quality attributes and aspects of the ecology of south-east Australian estuaries so as to provide a framework for addressing coastal management issues. The approach is based on the underlying causal factors of geology and morphology and more immediate environmental factors (e.g. salinity and sediments) which are associated with ecological distributions, species richness and fisheries catch. This [`] broad brush ' approach seeks to maximize reality and generality, albeit at the expense of precision and local variability in individual circumstances. It disregards small-scale ecological patterns as noise. Unlike in the Northern Hemisphere, conditions in temperate Australia are characterized by irregular flood and fire regimes that strongly influence estuary hydrology and nutrient inputs. Three main types of estuary (tide-dominated, wave-dominated and intermittently closed) are recognized based on geological criteria and having particular entrance conditions that control tidal exchange. Four zones (marine flood-tidal delta, central mud basin, fluvial delta and riverine channel/alluvial plain) are also recognized common to each type of estuary. These zones correspond to mappable sedimentary environments in all estuaries and have characteristic water quality, nutrient cycling/primary productivity signatures and ecosystems. The ecology of a zone is modified by (a) estuary type which determines the salinity regime; (b) stage of sediment filling (evolutionary maturity) which controls the spatial distribution/size of the zones; and (c) impacts of various forms of development. By using the zones/habitats as a common currency among all estuaries, it is possible to link ecological aspects such as species richness and commercial fisheries production so as to compare different estuaries or within-estuary zones. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {We are developing a three-dimensional numerical model that implements algorithms for sediment transport and evolution of bottom morphology in the coastal-circulation model Regional Ocean Modeling System ({ROMS} v3.0), and provides a two-way link between {ROMS} and the wave model Simulating Waves in the Nearshore ({SWAN}) via the Model-Coupling Toolkit. The coupled model is applicable for fluvial, estuarine, shelf, and nearshore (surfzone) environments. Three-dimensional radiation-stress terms have been included in the momentum equations, along with effects of a surface wave roller model. The sediment-transport algorithms are implemented for an unlimited number of user-defined non-cohesive sediment classes. Each class has attributes of grain diameter, density, settling velocity, critical stress threshold for erosion, and erodibility constant. Suspended-sediment transport in the water column is computed with the same advection--diffusion algorithm used for all passive tracers and an additional algorithm for vertical settling that is not limited by the {CFL} criterion. Erosion and deposition are based on flux formulations. A multi-level bed framework tracks the distribution of every size class in each layer and stores bulk properties including layer thickness, porosity, and mass, allowing computation of bed morphology and stratigraphy. Also tracked are bed-surface properties including active-layer thickness, ripple geometry, and bed roughness. Bedload transport is calculated for mobile sediment classes in the top layer. Bottom-boundary layer submodels parameterize wave--current interactions that enhance bottom stresses and thereby facilitate sediment transport and increase bottom drag, creating a feedback to the circulation. The model is demonstrated in a series of simple test cases and a realistic application in Massachusetts Bay.},

@article{suhayda_standing_1974,
	Abstract = {Simultaneous measurements of run-up spectra and nearshore wave spectra associated with standing waves have been made on a natural beach. Digital wave staffs and bottom-mounted pressure sensors were placed in a line at various distances offshore from a digital run-up meter. The run-up meter, which measured the position of the edge of the water, consisted of a series of electrical contacts suspended above the beach face and spaced 30 cm apart. Because of the possible influence of nonlinear interactions on the spectra, bicoherence was estimated, and the frequency range appropriate to a linearized model was defined. In this low-frequency region of the spectrum the cross-spectra phase angles between data records had values near 0 or π at frequencies of high coherence. The energy spectrum levels and the observed phase differences between records were in good agreement with the linear shallow water wave theory (Lamb, 1932) for standing waves on a plane beach. The general reflection coefficient for the data, estimated from the disagreement between data and standing wave theory, was found to be approximately 0.7. This result indicates that the theory of Miche (1944) for reflection from a plane beach predicts a reflection coefficient that is too high by a factor of approximately 1.5.},

@article{zacharioudaki_shoreline_2011,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates changes in shoreline evolution caused by changes   in wave climate. In particular, a number of nearshore wave climate   scenarios corresponding to a 'present' (1961-1990) and a future   time-slice (2071-2100) are used to drive a beach evolution model to   determine monthly and seasonal statistics. To limit the number of   variables, an idealised shoreline segment is adopted. The nearshore wave   climate scenarios are generated from wind climate scenarios through   point wave hindcast and inshore transformation. The original wind   forcing comes from regional climate change model experiments of   different resolutions and/or driving global climate models, representing   different greenhouse-gas emission scenarios. It corresponds to a   location offshore the south central coast of England. Hypothesis tests   are applied to map the degree of evidence of future change in wave and   shoreline statistics relative to the present. Differential statistics   resulting from different global climate models and future emission   scenarios are also investigated. Further, simple, fast, and   straightforward methods that are capable of accommodating a great number   of climate change scenarios with limited data reduction requirements are   proposed to tackle the problem under consideration. The results of this   study show that there are statistically significant changes in nearshore   wave climate conditions and beach alignment between current and future   climate scenarios. Changes are most notable during late summer for the   medium-high future emission scenario and late winter for the medium-low.   Despite frequent disagreement between global climate change models on   the statistical significance of a change, all experiments agreed in   future seasonal trends. Finally, a point of importance for coastal   management, material shoreline changes are generally linked to   significant changes in future wave direction rather than wave height.},

The {LES} model results compare reasonably well with laboratory measurements reported in the literature. As with Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes models, {LES} models effectively simulate the effects of submerged vegetation on the mean flow field, but they also account for the anisotropy of the Reynolds stresses due to the vegetation layer, and resolve coherent structures observed in the instantaneous flow field. Comparisons with fully developed flows in unobstructed (non-vegetated) channels are made to show how the vegetation significantly changes the mean flow, Reynolds shear stress, turbulence intensities, turbulence event frequencies and the energy budget within and above the vegetation layer. {LES} provides direct visual evidence that coherent structures, namely spanwise vortices (rolls) and streamwise vortices (ribs), develop at the water-plant interface at the top of the vegetation due to the well-known Kelvin--Helmholtz instability},

These theories, combined with observations, show that variations between estuaries are limited by how tides and river flow control sediments and bathymetry. Typical ages were determined from differences between theoretical and observed depths for Rias (11000 years), Coastal Plain (15000 years) and Bar-Built (100 years) estuaries.

@article{vries_infragravity_2010,
	Abstract = {In Autumn 2009, a field campaign was done in a secondary tidal inlet called the Slufter, located on the most southern Wadden island Texel, the Netherlands. A general definition of a Slufter, or secondary tidal inlet, is a salt or brackish dune valley, which is connected with the open sea and is flooded completely at least once a year. The aim of this research was to better understand infragravity wave behaviour at the Slufter during different energetic conditions and to investigate the influence of the supratidal beachplain on infragravity wave behaviour. The research is part of a larger research to better understand hydro- and morphodynamics of secondary tidal inlets. Infragravity, or low-frequency, wave height at the Slufter is related to offshore wave height and water depth. Low-frequency wave height remains constant in the shoaling and surf zone, whereas high-frequency wave height decreases. Low-frequency waves become more dominant over high-frequency waves in the inner surf and swash zone during normal, low-energetic, beach conditions. Low-frequency waves become increasingly skewed and asymmetric in the swash zone and break close to the. Low-frequency wave dissipation is caused by bed friction and low-frequency wave breaking and results in a cross-shore progressive infragravity wave pattern during low-energetic conditions, which contrasts with findings from other studies. During a storm event, the supratidal beachplain is flooded and low-frequency waves propagate over the beachplain. Low-frequency waves are dominant over high-frequency waves on top of the beachplain. However, the ratio is smaller than during normal beach conditions. Low-frequency waves become skewed and asymmetric while propagating over the beachplain, but do not break. During high-energetic conditions, low-frequency wave dissipation occurs at the landward side of the beachplain due to bed friction. Observations suggest that high-frequency wave-induced turbulence may also significantly contribute to low-frequency wave dissipation.},

@article{puleo_comprehensive_2014,
	Abstract = {Abstract A comprehensive study of swash-zone hydrodynamics and sediment transport was conducted on a macrotidal beach in Perranporth, United Kingdom. The unique study is the first to simultaneously measure suspended sediment and sheet flow sediment concentrations, water depth, near-bed velocity profiles, and high-resolution swash surface and bed-level changes on a natural beach. Data collected during the study are used to quantify the vertical profile of cross-shore and alongshore velocities and the importance of sheet flow sediment processes in the swash zone. The swash-zone boundary layer for cross-shore velocities is observed to generally occur over at least the lower 0.06 m of the water column. Alongshore velocities are often the same order of magnitude as the cross-shore velocities and are dominant near cross-shore flow reversal. Flows are often logarithmic in profile, but the instantaneous nature of the measurements renders application of the logarithmic model difficult. When valid, the logarithmic model enabled cross-shore shear stress estimates of up to with maximum alongshore shear stress estimates of , further highlighting the potential importance of alongshore flows. Friction coefficient estimates, assuming a quadratic drag law, showed no statistical difference between onshore- and offshore-directed motion, with typical values of . Sheet flow concentrations exceeded the maximum measured suspended sediment concentrations of approximately . Sediment loads in the sheet layer are up to 10 times larger than the sediment loads in the lower suspension layer. Simplified sheet flow sediment transport estimates are 3.6 times larger on average than those in the suspension layer. The latter two findings indicate the importance of sheet flow processes in the swash zone that are generally ignored.},

@article{baldock_morphodynamic_2008,
	Abstract = {New field observations of beach berm growth resulting in the sub-aerial   closure of an intermittently closed and open take or lagoon are   presented. These perched estuarine systems frequently exhibit ephemeral   entrances that respond to process forcing almost instantaneously on a   geomorphic timescale, with closure by a supra-tidal berm of depositional   origin. The observations were made following a mechanical opening of the   entrance and show very rapid vertical growth of an initially low beach   berm as a result of swash overtopping and sediment overwash. Very little   simultaneous seaward progradation was observed. Sediment overwash   volumes were obtained from survey data over a period of 12 days either   side of spring tide and the observations also provide an accurate   measure of swash sediment transport at the berm crest. A process-based   parametric model is developed through robust parameterisations of wave   run-up, wave run-up distributions and sediment transport and is applied   to predict the total overwash transport into and infilling the estuary   entrance. The model is tested against the field data and compares well   with the observations. While the field data are site-specific, the   proposed modelling framework represents a first step in modelling the   complex growth and recovery of natural beach berms in broad-scale   morphodynamic models.

@article{gacia_sediment_2001,
	Abstract = {The role of Posidonia oceanica in promoting sediment stability and accretion was studied in a 15 m deep meadow at Fanals Point ({NW} Mediterranean, Spain) by comparing particle deposition within the meadow and adjacent bare sediment. Small sediment traps were used to measure deposition within and above the meadow and over bare sand. A model, based on measurements of particle deposition at increasing distances from the bottom, was used to partition the total depositional flux between primary (sediment particles deposited for the first time at the measuring site) and resuspended deposition (sediment particles that have been previously deposited at the measuring site). Measurements were conducted monthly over a year to establish the magnitude and seasonality of deposition, and to form a balance of particle transport at the annual time scale. Significant differences in total deposition were found over time, ranging from 1·5 to 500 g {DW} m−2 d−1, including those between bare and vegetated sediments. The effect of P. oceanica in increasing primary deposition at an annual scale was modest, however, P. oceanica significantly buffered sediment resuspension, which was reduced more than three fold compared to the unvegetated bottom. The annual flux of deposition was dominated by settling of resuspended materials, which represented 85\% of the total flux within the meadow, but 95\% of the total deposition on bare sand. Thus, seagrass meadows reduce resuspension in the {NW} Mediterranean littoral, thereby contributing to increased sediment retention and, therefore, reducing erosion in the coastal zone.},

Two computer laboratory exercises are presented which enable students to understand many of the facets of random signal analysis with less difficulty and more understanding than standard classroom instruction alone. The first pedagogical exercise, described in the previous article, uses mathematical software on which the students execute the manual arithmetic operations of a finite Fourier analysis on a complex wave record. The results are then compared to those obtained by a fast Fourier transform. This article, the second of this two-part pedagogical series, addresses analysis of a complex sea using observed and theoretical wave height and water surface elevation probability distributions and wave spectra. These results are compared to a fast Fourier transformanalysis, thus providing a link back to the first exercise.},

@article{weir_beach_2006,
	Abstract = {This study documents two different modes of berm development: (1) vertical growth at spring tides or following significant beach cut due to substantial swash overtopping, and (2) horizontal progradation at neap tides through the formation of a proto-berm located lower and further seaward of the principal berm. Concurrent high-frequency measurements of bed elevation and the associated wave runup distribution reveal the details of each of these berm growth modes. In mode 1 sediment is eroded from the inner surf and lower swash zone where swash interactions are prevalent. The net transport of this sediment is landward only, resulting in accretion onto the upper beach face and over the berm crest. The final outcome is a steepening of the beach face gradient, a change in the profile shape towards concave and rapid vertical and horizontal growth of the berm. In mode 2 sediment is eroded from the lower two-thirds of the active swash zone during the rising tide and is transported both landward and seaward. On the falling tide sediment is eroded from the inner surf and transported landward to backfill the zone eroded on the rising tide. The net result is relatively slow steepening of the beach face, a change of the profile shape towards convex, and horizontal progradation through the formation of a neap berm. The primary factor determining which mode of berm growth occurs is the presence or absence of swash overtopping at the time of sediment accumulation on the beach face. This depends on the current phase of the spring-neap tide cycle, the wave runup height (and indirectly offshore wave conditions) and the height of the pre-existing berm. A conceptual model for berm morphodynamics is presented, based on sediment transport shape functions measured during the two modes of berm growth.},

The resulting feature is dependent upon barrier configuration, depths in the lagoon adjacent to the barrier, and the direction from which the storm surge came, either from the sea or the lagoon. Attack on barrier islands from the seaward side by waves overtopping the barrier will result in washover fans on wide barriers where extensive adjoining tidal flats are present. Inlets can be cut by this type attack on narrow barriers where no tidal flats are present. Storm surge from the lagoonal side, if channeled along tidal creeks, can easily cut inlets through a barrier.},

@article{olabarrieta_wave-current_2011,
	Abstract = {This paper describes the importance of wave-current interaction in an inlet-estuary system. The three-dimensional, fully coupled, Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport ({COAWST}) modeling system was applied in Willapa Bay (Washington State) from 22 to 29 October 1998 that included a large storm event. To represent the interaction between waves and currents, the vortex-force method was used. Model results were compared with water elevations, currents, and wave measurements obtained by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers. In general, a good agreement between field data and computed results was achieved, although some discrepancies were also observed in regard to wave peak directions in the most upstream station. Several numerical experiments that considered different forcing terms were run in order to identify the effects of each wind, tide, and wave-current interaction process. Comparison of the horizontal momentum balances results identified that wave-breaking-induced acceleration is one of the leading terms in the inlet area. The enhancement of the apparent bed roughness caused by waves also affected the values and distribution of the bottom shear stress. The pressure gradient showed significant changes with respect to the pure tidal case. During storm conditions the momentum balance in the inlet shares the characteristics of tidal-dominated and wave-dominated surf zone environments. The changes in the momentum balance caused by waves were manifested both in water level and current variations. The most relevant effect on hydrodynamics was a wave-induced setup in the inner part of the estuary.},

@article{junge_microscopic_2001,
	Abstract = {Microbial populations and activity within sea ice have been well described based on bulk measurements from melted sea-ice samples. However, melting destroys the micro-environments within the ice matrix and does not allow for examination of microbial populations at a spatial scale relevant to the organism. Here, we describe the development of a new method allowing for microscopic observations of bacteria localized within the three-dimensional network of brine inclusions in sea ice under in situ conditions. Conventional bacterial staining procedures, using the {DNA}-specific fluorescent stain {DAPI}, epifluorescence microscopy and image analysis, were adapted to examine bacteria and their associations with various surfaces within microtomed sections of sea ice at temperatures from −2$\,^{\circ}$ to −15$\,^{\circ}$C. The utility and sensitivity of the method were demonstrated by analyzing artificial sea-ice preparations of decimal dilutions of a known bacterial culture. When applied to natural, particle-rich sea ice, the method allowed distinction between bacteria and particles at high magnification. At lower magnifications, observations of bacteria could be combined with those of other organisms and with morphology and particle content of the pore space. The method described here may ultimately aid in discerning constraints on microbial life at extremely low temperatures.},

	Abstract = {Rapid declines in summer Arctic sea ice extent are projected under high-forcing future climate scenarios. Regional Arctic climate engineering has been suggested as an emergency strategy to save the sea ice. Model simulations of idealized regional dimming experiments compared to a business-as-usual greenhouse gas emission simulation demonstrate the importance of both local and remote feedback mechanisms to the surface energy budget in high latitudes. With increasing artificial reduction in incoming shortwave radiation, the positive surface albedo feedback from Arctic sea ice loss is reduced. However, changes in Arctic clouds and the strongly increasing northward heat transport both counteract the direct dimming effects. A 4 times stronger local reduction in solar radiation compared to a global experiment is required to preserve summer Arctic sea ice area. Even with regional Arctic dimming, a reduction in the strength of the oceanic meridional overturning circulation and a shut down of Labrador Sea deep convection are possible.},

@article{symonds_wave-driven_1995,
	Abstract = {Long-term (1 month) observations of waves and currents over a natural reef are presented which show a strong correlation between offshore rms incident wave height and cross-reef currents at subtidal frequencies. The energy spectrum of the cross-reef currents shows a significant peak at twice the semidiurnal tidal frequency, while the spectrum of sea surface elevation over the reef flat shows no corresponding peak. Furthermore, experimental results reported by Gourlay (1993) show setup over the reef occurs in the absence of a beach, and the cross-reef transport decreases with an increase in the sea surface slope across the reef flat due to an increase in setup at the top of the reef face. Analytic solutions for flow forced by wave breaking over an idealized reef explain the above features of cross-reef flows in the absence of a beach. Through the surf zone on the reef face the cross-reef gradient in the radiation stress due to wave breaking is partitioned between balancing an offshore pressure gradient associated with setup over the reef and forcing a mean flow across the reef. Over the reef flat, where the depth is constant, there is no forcing due to wave breaking and the flow is driven by a pressure gradient which results from the setup through the surf zone. The magnitude of the setup through the surf zone is such that the transport across the reef flat matches the transport through the surf zone which is forced by the gradient in the radiation stress. Solutions are presented for general reef geometry, defined by the reef width and slope of the seaward reef face, and incident wave forcing, defined by the depth at the breakpoint and the depth of water over the reef. As the depth over the reef goes to zero, the solutions converge to the plane beach solutions described by Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1964), wave setup is maximized, and the cross-reef transport is zero. In other cases the relative magnitudes of the setup and the cross-reef transport depend on the geometry of the reef and the incident wave forcing.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Our capability for predicting beach and dune erosion has improved in the last three decades, but the recovery of an eroded beach above the mean sea level ({MSL}) cannot be predicted at present. The cycle of beach erosion and recovery will need to be predicted for the long-term maintenance of a sand beach with a dune for coastal flooding reduction. The cross-shore numerical model ({CSHORE}) is extended and evaluated using natural beach erosion and recovery data along 16 cross-shore lines spanning 5 km alongshore for the duration of 272 days. The {CSHORE} predicts beach and dune erosion fairly well, as has been shown in previous comparisons. The bed-load formula used in the {CSHORE} is adjusted to predict the accreted beach profile with a berm. The computed beach profile evolutions are shown to be affected little by the alongshore gradient of the longshore sediment transport rate along the straight beach. The extended {CSHORE} predicts both erosion and accretion above {MSL} within a factor of about 2.},

When swashes first filled the initially circular hole on the rising tide, the dominant mode observed in the cross‐shore velocity was consistent with a zero‐order Bessel function solution (sloshing back and forth). As the tide rose and swash transported sediment, the hole diameter decreased, the water depth inside the hole remained approximately constant, and the frequency of the sloshing mode increased according to theory. About an hour after the swashes first reached the hole, it had evolved from a closed circle to a semi‐circle, open to the ocean. When the hole was nearly semi‐circular, the observed cross‐shore velocity had two spectral peaks, one associated with the sloshing of a closed circle, the other associated with a quarter‐wavelength mode in an open semi‐circle, both consistent with theory. As the hole evolved further toward a fully semi‐circular shape, the circular sloshing mode decreased, while the quarter‐wavelength mode became dominant.},

	Abstract = {The fishes in Lower Putah Creek, a regulated stream in the Central Valley of California, were sampled over a 5-yr period, 1994-1998. Distinct fish assemblages were observed in the lower 37 km of stream using two-way indicator species analysis ({TWIN}-{SPAN}) and canonical correspondence analysis ({CCA}). The assemblages segregated in an upstream-to-downstream manner. Distinct differences were found between assemblages of native and nonnative fishes and their association with environmental variables and habitat use. Native fishes tended to cluster in areas with colder temperatures, lower conductivity, less pool habitat, faster streamflow, and more shaded stream surface. Numbers of nonnative fish were negatively correlated with increased streamflow, and numbers of native fish were positively correlated with increased flow. Hydrologic variability between years and seasons indicated that flow regime had a large effect on the fish assemblages. This study provides a clear demonstration of how native fishes in streams of the western United States exhibit different habitat requirements and respond to temporal variation in flow in a different manner than nonnative fishes. It supports the concept that restoration of natural flow regimes, in company with other restoration measures, is necessary if the continued downward decline of native fish populations in the western United States is to be reversed.},

@article{dunton_nearshore_2006,
	Abstract = {The nearshore shelf of the Beaufort Sea is defined by extreme physical and biological gradients that have a distinctive influence on its productivity and trophic structure. Massive freshwater discharge from the Mackenzie River, along with numerous smaller rivers and streams elsewhere along the coast, produce an environment that is decidedly estuarine in character, especially in late spring and summer. Consequently, the Beaufort coast provides a critical habitat for several species of amphidromous fishes, some of which are essential to the subsistence lifestyle of arctic native populations. Because of its low in situ productivity, allochthonous inputs of organic carbon, identifiable on the basis of isotopic composition, are important to the functioning of this arctic estuarine system. Coastal erosion and river discharge are largely responsible for introducing high concentrations of suspended sediment from upland regions into the nearshore zone. The depletion in the 13C content of invertebrate and vertebrate consumers, which drops about 4--5‰ eastward along the eastern Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast, may reflect the assimilation of this terrestrial organic matter into local food webs. In addition, the large range in 13C values of fauna collected in the eastern Beaufort (nearly 8‰) compared to the same species in the northeastern Chukchi (3‰), indicate a lower efficiency of carbon transfer between trophic levels in the eastern Beaufort. The wider spread in stable isotope values in the eastern Beaufort may also reflect a decoupling between benthic and pelagic components. Isotopic tracer studies of amphidromous fishes in the Simpson Island barrier island lagoon revealed that terrestrial (peat) carbon may contribute as much as 30--50\% of their total dietary requirements. On the eastern Alaska Beaufort Sea coast, the δ13C values of arctic cod collected in semi-enclosed lagoons were more depleted, by 3--4‰, compared to fish collected in the coastal Beaufort Sea. Calculations from isotopic mixing equations indicate cod from lagoons may derive 70\% of their carbon from terrestrial sources. The δ15N values of lagoon fish were also 4‰ lower than coastal specimens, reflective of the lower δ15N values of terrestrially derived nitrogen (0--1.5‰ compared to 5--7‰ for phytoplankton). The role of terrestrial carbon in arctic estuarine food webs is especially important in view of the current warming trend in the arctic environment and the role of advective processes that transport carbon along the nearshore shelf. Biogeochemical studies of the arctic coastal estuarine environment may provide more insights into the function of these biologically complex ecosystems.},

@article{gonzalez_edge_1995,
	Abstract = {The 25 April 1992 Cape Mendocino earthquake generated a tsunami characterized by both coastal trapped edge wave and non-trapped tsunami modes that propagated north and south along the U.S. West Coast. Both observed and synthetic time series at Crescent City and North Spit are consistent with the zero-order edge wave mode solution for a semi-infinite sloping beach depth profile. Wave amplitudes at Crescent City were about twice that observed at North Spit, in spite of the fact that the source region was three times farther from Crescent City than North Spit. The largest observed amplitude was due to an edge wave which arrived almost three hours after the initial onset of the tsunami; since such waves are highly localized nearshore, this suggests that the enhanced responsiveness at Crescent City is at least partly due to local dynamic processes. Furthermore, the substantially delayed arrival of this wave, which was generated at the southern end of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, has significant implications for hazard mitigation efforts along the entire U.S. West Coast. Specifically, this study demonstrates that slow-moving but very energetic edge wave modes could be generated by future large tsunamigenic earthquakes in the {CSZ}, and that these might arrive unexpectedly at coastal communities several hours after the initial tsunami waves have subsided.},

A fetch-limited wave model driven by sea ice position and local wind data from northern Alaska indicates that the exposure of permafrost bluffs to seawater increased by a factor of 2.5 during 1979--2009. The duration of the open water season expanded from ∼45 days to ∼95 days. Open water expanded more rapidly toward the fall (∼0.92 day yr−1), when sea surface temperatures are cooler, than into the mid-summer (∼0.71 days yr−1).Time-lapse imagery demonstrates the relatively efficient erosive action of a single storm in August. Sea surface temperatures have already decreased significantly by fall, reducing the potential impact of thermal erosion due to fall season storm waves.},

@article{berkenbusch_liquid_2008,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a numerical analysis of the transition from selective withdrawal to viscous entrainment. In our model problem, an interface between two immiscible layers of equal viscosity is deformed by an axisymmetric withdrawal flow, which is driven by a point sink located some distance above the interface in the upper layer. We find that steady-state hump solutions, corresponding to selective withdrawal of liquid from the upper layer, cease to exist above a threshold withdrawal flux, and that this transition corresponds to a saddle-node bifurcation for the hump solutions. Numerical results on the shape evolution of the steady-state interface are compared against previous experimental measurements. We find good agreement where the data overlap. However, the larger dynamic range of the numerical results allows us to show that the large increase in the curvature of the hump tip near transition is not consistent with an approach towards a power-law cusp shape, an interpretation previously suggested from inspection of the experimental measurements alone. Instead, the large increase in the curvature at the hump tip reflects a robust trend in the steady-state interface evolution. For large deflections, the hump height is proportional to the logarithm of the curvature at the hump tip; thus small changes in hump height correspond to large changes in the value of the hump curvature.},

@article{burchard_dynamic_2008,
	Abstract = {In this paper, a time-dependent dynamic equation for the potential energy anomaly, {\"I}*, is rigorously derived from dynamic equations for potential temperature and salinity, the continuity equation and the equation of state for sea water. The terms locally changing {\"I}* are (A) the {\"I}*-advection, (B) the depth-mean straining, (C) the non-mean straining, (D) the vertical advection, (E) the vertical mixing, (F) surface and bottom density fluxes, (G) inner sources of density e.g. due to absorption of solar radiation and the non-linearity of the equation of state, and (H) horizontal divergence of horizontal turbulent density fluxes. In order to derive the equation in concise form, a vertical velocity (linearly varying with depth) with respect to depth-proportional vertical coordinates had to be defined. The evaluation of the terms in the {\"I}*-equation is then carried out for a one-dimensional tidal straining study and a two-dimensional estuarine circulation study. Comparisons to empirical estimates for these terms are made for the one-dimensional study. It is concluded that the {\"I}*-equation provides a general reference for empirical bulk parameterisations of stratification and mixing processes in estuaries and coastal seas and that it is a tool for complete analysis of the relevant terms from numerical models.},

	Abstract = {Wave-current interactions play a major role in the dynamics of shallow tidal inlets. This study investigates these interactions at a natural inlet, with a strong focus on current-induced changes on wave propagation. The analysis of hydrodynamic data collected at the Albufeira lagoon, Portugal, revealed spatiotemporal variations of water levels and wave heights along the inlet, attributed to wave-current interaction processes. We compared the simulations of a coupled wave-circulation modeling system, computed with and without waves, and propagated with and without current feedback. The wave-induced setup inside the lagoon represented 7\%--15\% of the offshore significant wave height. The accuracy of the wave's predictions improved when current feedback was included. During ebb, the currents increased the wave height at the mouth of the inlet (up to 20\%) and decreased the wave height in the inlet (up to 40\%), due to current-induced refraction, steepness dissipation, and partial blocking. During flood, the currents decreased the wave height in the inlet (up to 10\%) and increased the wave height at the exterior parts of the ebb shoal (up to 10\%), due to current-induced refraction. These effects significantly attenuate seaward sediment fluxes during ebb and contribute to the sediment accretion in the inlet.},

Observations of infragravity response were obtained during sea breeze and swell periods with wave height varying from 0.2 to 1.2 m and wave period from 3 to 16 s. The observations show a stronger infragravity response to longer period incident swell than to short period wind-sea. During the peak of the sea breeze, short period wind-sea is conducive to long wave generation by breakpoint forcing. Under swell-dominated conditions, the frequency and wave number of incoming bound waves associated with wave groups may satisfy the linear dispersion relationship, leading to resonant forcing of a free wave that appears to be released from the wave group. The transition between long wave generation due to bound wave release and time-varying breakpoint forcing agrees with the surf beat similarity parameter.},

	Abstract = {Increased nutrient loading to estuaries has led to eutrophication, degraded water quality, and ecological transformations. Quantifying nutrient loads in systems with significant groundwater input can be difficult due to the challenge of measuring groundwater fluxes. We quantified tidal and freshwater fluxes over an 8-week period at the entrance of West Falmouth Harbor, Massachusetts, a eutrophic, groundwater-fed estuary. Fluxes were estimated from velocity and salinity measurements and a total exchange flow ({TEF}) methodology. Intermittent cross-sectional measurements of velocity and salinity were used to convert point measurements to cross-sectionally averaged values over the entire deployment (index relationships). The estimated mean freshwater flux (0.19 m3/s) for the 8-week period was mainly due to groundwater input (0.21 m3/s) with contributions from precipitation to the estuary surface (0.026 m3/s) and removal by evaporation (0.048 m3/s). Spring--neap variations in freshwater export that appeared in shorter-term averages were mostly artifacts of the index relationships. Hydrodynamic modeling with steady groundwater input demonstrated that while the {TEF} methodology resolves the freshwater flux signal, calibration of the index--salinity relationships during spring tide conditions only was responsible for most of the spring--neap signal. The mean freshwater flux over the entire period estimated from the combination of the index-velocity, index--salinity, and {TEF} calculations were consistent with the model, suggesting that this methodology is a reliable way of estimating freshwater fluxes in the estuary over timescales greater than the spring--neap cycle. Combining this type of field campaign with hydrodynamic modeling provides guidance for estimating both magnitude of groundwater input and estuarine storage of freshwater and sets the stage for robust estimation of the nutrient load in groundwater.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
General governing equations for estuaries and coastal regions are given as a special case of those of Newtonian fluids under the influence of turbulence, density gradient, atmospheric pressure gradient, and tide-generating force. The equations are then simplified for barotropic motion, particularly tidal, seiche, and tidally-driven motions. The linearized equations are used to discuss frictional tidal propagation in an elongated straight channel. The importance of the Earth's rotation is then discussed with the Kelvin wave solutions in a long channel. For barotropic tidal or seiche problems, the Earth's rotation is shown to be quite small in general when there is no stratification. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) models are then discussed for the effect of variable bathymetry. The bottom friction and cross-channel depth variations are shown to have significant effect on the tidal phase and tidal ellipses of the current velocity. The sub-tidal (or residual) flow is then discussed for variable depth problems. Some relevant observations of sub-tidal flows are then analyzed. A technique to separate barotropic from baroclinic motions is discussed and the effect of channel curvature examined using both analytic model and observations. It is demonstrated that the advective nonlinearity is a dominant term when channel curvature and bathymetry variations are significant.},

	Abstract = {We have studied cross isopycnal (diapycnal) and lateral mixing and stirring below the sill of Santa Monica Basin by releasing two tracers, sulfur hexafluoride and perfluorodecalin, as close as possible to an isopycnal surface and measuring their subsequent dispersion. The target for the release was a potential temperature surface at about 790 m depth, roughly 100 m above the bottom and 50 m below the sill. Three surveys, performed immediately after, about 7 weeks after, and about 6 months after the release, showed that the time scales for lateral stirring and mixing in the basin were between 2 and 5 months. The diapycnal diffusivity for the whole period was found to be 0.29$\pm$0.06cm2/s near the injection surface, where the buoyancy frequency was about 1.1 cph. This estimate may include some mixing in the turbulent boundary layer near the walls of the basin. Our best estimate for the diapycnal diffusivity in the basin interior is 0.25$\pm$0.08 cm2/s.},

This earthquake generated a tsunami that struck Japan as well as various locations around the Pacific Ocean. With the participation of researchers from throughout Japan, joint research groups conducted a tsunami survey along a 2000 km stretch of the Japanese coast. More than 5300 locations have been surveyed to date, generating the largest tsunami survey dataset in the world. On the Sendai Plain, the maximum inundation height was 19.5 m, and the tsunami bore propagated more than 5 km inland. Along the ria coast from about 50 to 200 km north of Sendai, the narrow bays focused the tsunami waves, generating the largest inundation heights and run-ups. The survey data clearly show a regional dependence of tsunami characteristics.},

@article{mudd_how_2010,
	Abstract = {Plants are known to enhance sedimentation on intertidal marshes. It is unclear, however, if the dominant mechanism of enhanced sedimentation is direct organic sedimentation, particle capture by plant stems, or enhanced settling due to a reduction in turbulent kinetic energy within flows through the plant canopy. Here we combine several previously reported laboratory studies with an 18 year record of salt marsh macrophyte characteristics to quantify these mechanisms. In dense stands of Spartina alterniflora (with projected plant areas per unit volume of {\textgreater}10 m−1) and rapid flows ({\textgreater}0.4 m s−1), we find that the fraction of sedimentation from particle capture can instantaneously exceed 70\%. In most marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora, however, we find particle settling, rather than capture, will account for the majority of inorganic sedimentation. We examine a previously reported 2 mm yr−1 increase in accretion rate following a fertilization experiment in South Carolina. Prior studies at the site have ruled out organic sedimentation as the cause of this increased accretion. We apply our newly developed models of particle capture and effective settling velocity to the fertilized and control sites and find that virtually all ({\textgreater}99\%) of the increase in accretion rates can be attributed to enhanced settling brought about by reduced turbulent kinetic energy in the fertilized canopy. Our newly developed models of biologically mediated sedimentation are broadly applicable and can be applied to marshes where data relating biomass to stem diameter and projected plant area are available.},

@article{lessa_morphodynamic_2000,
	Abstract = {Field and numerical investigations on the hydrodynamics of shallow estuaries have suggested that the dominant current direction can be assessed through the examination of the water level record. Shorter rising tides induce stronger flood currents, whereas faster falling tides cause stronger ebb currents. Monthly measurements of tides and current velocities in two shallow macrotidal estuaries in eastern Australia show that the hydrodynamics are controlled by two topographical entities, namely the depth of the channel bed across the ebb tidal delta and the elevation of the mangrove banks. Vertical tidal attenuation and asymmetry are related to the degree of tidal truncation at low tide. Lower spring low tide levels increase tidal truncation inside the estuary, causing longer stationary tide levels at low tide and more pronounced tidal attenuation. Neap tides, although still very asymmetric, may propagate freely inside the estuary, as low tide level stays above the elevation of the channel. Velocity measurements show that the expected flood dominance, due to the sense of the vertical tidal asymmetry, occurs only during neap tides. As tides rise above the mangrove levels during spring cycles, stronger ebb fluxes are observed, and the system becomes overwhelmingly ebb dominant. Thus, based on current prognostic models for shallow estuary hydrodynamics, the spring-to-neap trend in vertical asymmetry radically opposes the trend in flow regime.},

	Abstract = {The 25 April 1992 Cape Mendocino earthquake generated a tsunami characterized by both coastal trapped edge wave and non-trapped tsunami modes that propagated north and south along the U.S. West Coast. Both observed and synthetic time series at Crescent City and North Spit are consistent with the zero-order edge wave mode solution for a semi-infinite sloping beach depth profile. Wave amplitudes at Crescent City were about twice that observed at North Spit, in spite of the fact that the source region was three times farther from Crescent City than North Spit. The largest observed amplitude was due to an edge wave which arrived almost three hours after the initial onset of the tsunami; since such waves are highly localized nearshore, this suggests that the enhanced responsiveness at Crescent City is at least partly due to local dynamic processes. Furthermore, the substantially delayed arrival of this wave, which was generated at the southern end of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, has significant implications for hazard mitigation efforts along the entire U.S. West Coast. Specifically, this study demonstrates that slow-moving but very energetic edge wave modes could be generated by future large tsunamigenic earthquakes in the {CSZ}, and that these might arrive unexpectedly at coastal communities several hours after the initial tsunami waves have subsided.},

@article{gerald_model_2006,
	Abstract = {In a regime of accelerated sea-level rise the Bruun concept predicts that sand will be transferred from the beach to nearshore in order to re-establish the equilibrium slope. Added to this loss of sediment from the barrier is the sand that will be removed from the littoral system at tidal inlets. This paper presents a three-stage conceptual model of sand trapping processes at tidal inlets and the long-term response of the barrier chain to a diminished sediment supply. The model applies to mixed-energy barrier coasts such as those along the East Coast of the United States, East Friesian Islands in the North Sea, and the Copper River Delta barriers in the Gulf of Alaska. These coasts are characterized by short stubby barrier islands, numerous tidal inlets, well developed ebb-tidal deltas, and a backbarrier consisting of supratidal salt marshes, tidal flats, and/or mangroves incised by tidal creeks. Acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise will gradually, or catastrophically depending upon the rate, change the hypsometry of the backbarrier transforming supratidal areas to open water and intertidal environments. The loss of marshlands will increase tidal exchange between the ocean and backbarrier and ultimately change the hydraulic regime of the tidal inlets. The growth of both ebb and flood-tidal deltas diminishes the supply of sand along the coast leading to a fragmentation of the barrier chain and formation of a transgressive coastal system. The ultimate fate of the barriers and their re-establishment onshore is dependent on the trend of sea-level rise. An extensive literature review suggests that backbarrier regions around the world may response to sea-level rise quite differently due to variations in sediment supply and saltmarsh accretion rates.},

	Abstract = {Abstract We used a non?linear model, which incorporates tidal choking coupled to the geometry of the lagoon and its channel to interpret data collected from two constricted New Zealand lagoons, Hooper's Inlet and Papanui Inlet, Otago Peninsula, south eastern New Zealand. The model reproduced many of the observed features, although it yielded better results for Papanui Inlet which had weaker tidal choking. Tide data from both lagoons showed varying degrees of distortion owing to the constricted channels. Both lagoons were characterised by a reduced amplitude and a lag in the timing of high and low tides compared to the open sea reference point at Taiaroa Head, with an irregular ebb?flood duration. Although Taiaroa Head had a mean tidal range of 1.49 m and its high and low tides occurred first, Papanui Inlet had a tidal range of 1.15m and lagged Taiaroa Head by 60 min, whereas adjacent Hooper's Inlet had the smallest range of 0.43m and a lag of 103 min. All sites had a clear spring?neap envelope, with Hooper's Inlet lagging behind Taiaroa Head and Papanui Inlet by about 1 day. The reduced amplitude and the lag in timing of high and low tides compared to the forcing open sea tide are caused by tidal choking owing to the narrow, shallow channels connecting the lagoons to the open sea.},

The tidal signal can either be discarded, or its characteristics described in some fashion useful for further analysis. Although tidal signals can be removed by standard high or bandpass filtering techniques, their relatively deterministic character and large amplitude make special techniques more effective. In classical harmonic analysis, the tidal signal is modelled as the sum of a finite set of sinusoids at specific frequencies related to astronomical parameters. A set of programs has been written in {MATLAB} to (a) perform classical harmonic analysis for periods of about 1 year or shorter, (b) account for (some) unresolved constituents using nodal corrections, and (c) compute confidence intervals for the analyzed components.},

	Abstract = {Wastewater discharges affect the functioning of small temporarily   open/closed estuaries ({TOCEs}) through two main mechanisms: (1) they can   significantly change the water balance by altering the quantity of water   inflows, and (2) they can significantly change the nutrient balance and   hence the water quality. This study investigated the bio-physical   responses of a typical, small {TOCE} on the east coast of South Africa,   the Mhlanga Estuary. This estuary receives significant inflows of   treated effluent from upstream wastewater treatment works. Water and   nutrient budgets were used together with biological sampling to   investigate changes in the functioning of the system. The increase in   inflows due to the effluent discharges has significantly increased the   mouth breaching frequency. Furthermore, when the mouth closes, the   accumulation of nutrients leads to eutrophication and algal blooms. A   grey water index, namely the proportion of effluent in the estuary and   an indicator of the additional nutrient inputs into the estuary, reached   high values (greater than or similar to 50\%) during low flow regimes and   when the mouth was closed. In these hyper-eutrophic conditions ({DIN} and   {DIP} concentrations up to 457 mu M and 100 mu M respectively), field   measurements showed that algal blooms occurred within about 14 days   following closure of the mouth (chlorophyll-a concentrations up to 375   mg chl-a m(-3)). Water and nutrient balance simulations for alternative   scenarios suggest that further increases in wastewater discharges would   result in more frequent breaching events and longer open mouth   conditions, but the occurrence of hyper-eutrophic conditions would   initially intensify despite more frequent openings. The study indicates   how water and nutrient balance simulations can be used in the planning   and impact assessment of wastewater treatment facilities. (C) 2010   Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {The strong tidal modulation of infragravity (200 to 20 s period) waves observed on the southern California shelf is shown to be the result of nonlinear transfers of energy from these low-frequency long waves to higher-frequency motions. The energy loss occurs in the surfzone, and is stronger as waves propagate over the convex low-tide beach profile than over the concave high-tide profile, resulting in a tidal modulation of seaward-radiated infragravity energy. Although previous studies have attributed infragravity energy losses in the surfzone to bottom drag and turbulence, theoretical estimates using both observations and numerical simulations suggest nonlinear transfers dominate. The observed beach profiles and energy transfers are similar along several km of the southern California coast, providing a mechanism for the tidal modulation of infragravity waves observed in bottom-pressure and seismic records on the continental shelf and in the deep ocean.},

The salt wedge was found to vary considerably in position and vertical structure through the tidal cycle due to the interaction of the tidal flow with the density-driven motion of the salt wedge. During the flood, the salt wedge progressed up the estuary as a gravity current, while during the ebb the salinity structure was eroded by shear instability. The difference in character of the flow between flood and ebb is attributed to the transition between a subcritical and supercritical internal Froude number. During flood tide, the internal state is subcritical, and the estuarine shear flow is maintained with a small amount of vertical mixing, while in the supercritical ebb flow, vertical shears become so large that the pycnoc...},

	Abstract = {Infragravity-wave (periods of one-half to a few minutes) energy levels observed for about 1 year in 8-m water depth in the Pacific and in 8- and 13-m depths in the Atlantic are highly correlated with energy in the swell-frequency band (7- to 20-s periods), suggesting the infragravity waves were generated locally by the swell. The amplification of infragravity-wave energy between 13- and 8-m depth (separated by 1 km in the cross shore) is about 2, indicating that the observed infragravity motions are dominated by free waves, not by group-forced bound waves, which in theory are amplified by an order of magnitude in energy between the two locations. However, bound waves are more important for the relatively few cases with very energetic swell, when the observed amplification between 13- and 8-m depth of infragravity-wave energy was sometimes 3 times greater than expected for free waves. Bispectra are consistent with increased coupling between infragravity waves and groups of swell and sea for high-energy incident waves.},

A generalized Darcy's law (Dagan, 1979) is adopted to describe the oscillatory flow motions in the sea bed. Boundary layers are required in the sea bed adjacent to boundaries due to the discontinuity of medium property. A boundary-layer-Poincar{\'e} method is used to derive the damping rate and to obtain in addition the small wave number shift due to viscosity. The damping rate is shown to increase with permeability for small permeability and then to decrease with permeability for large permeability.

@article{chen_nearshore_2007,
	Abstract = {The effects of seagrass bed geometry on wave attenuation and suspended sediment transport were investigated using a modified Nearshore Community Model ({NearCoM}). The model was enhanced to account for cohesive sediment erosion and deposition, sediment transport, combined wave and current shear stresses, and seagrass effects on drag. Expressions for seagrass drag as a function of seagrass shoot density and canopy height were derived from published flume studies of model vegetation. The predicted reduction of volume flux for steady flow through a bed agreed reasonably well with a separate flume study. Predicted wave attenuation qualitatively captured seasonal patterns observed in the field: wave attenuation peaked during the flowering season and decreased as shoot density and canopy height decreased. Model scenarios with idealized bathymetries demonstrated that, when wave orbital velocities and the seagrass canopy interact, increasing seagrass bed width in the direction of wave propagation results in higher wave attenuation, and increasing incoming wave height results in higher relative wave attenuation. The model also predicted lower skin friction, reduced erosion rates, and higher bottom sediment accumulation within and behind the bed. Reduced erosion rates within seagrass beds have been reported, but reductions in stress behind the bed require further studies for verification. Model results suggest that the mechanism of sediment trapping by seagrass beds is more complex than reduced erosion rates alone; it also requires suspended sediment sources outside of the bed and horizontal transport into the bed.},

	Abstract = {Texel inlet, the largest inlet in the Dutch Wadden Sea, has undergone drastic changes in the morphology of basin, ebb-tidal delta and adjacent coastlines after closure of a major part of its back-barrier basin. Despite intensive monitoring and analysis, present observation-based conceptual models lack the subtle physics necessary to explain the sand exchange between inlet, ebb-tidal delta and adjacent coastlines.
Fundamental understanding of the inlet dynamics and evolution is obtained by integrating field and model data analysis. The state-of-the-art process-based model Delft3D Online Morphology has been used to generate synoptic data of high spatial and temporal resolution over the inlet domain. It is shown that the Delft3D Online Morphology model is capable of the quasi real-time simulation of the dominant flow and transport patterns over a 3-month period on the scale of the inlet. The high-resolution numerical model results prove to be a valuable tool in identifying the main transport patterns and mechanisms in the inlet domain. Qualitative transport patterns in Texel Inlet and its associated ebb-tidal delta are derived by integration of the observations and model results.
The present ebb-tidal delta developments are best described as a second-stage self-organizing phase of redistribution and recirculation of sediments to obtain a natural dynamic equilibrium state, adapted to the changed configuration of the main-ebb channels. Sand is transported from the abandoned ebb-delta front (western margin of Noorderhaaks) and along the adjacent coastlines into the basin where it partly settles. Ebb-tidal currents redistribute sand back from the basin mainly onto the southern ebb-tidal delta shoals. Large gross transport rates, but small morphological changes, point to sediment recirculation. Sediment import into the basin results from net flood dominated transport due to tidal asymmetry, landward directed wind- and wave-driven flow, and larger flood transport capacities due to wave effects (e.g. enhanced bed shear stresses and stirring of sediment) that exceed the net ebb-dominated tidal residual transports.},

The results show that the nocturnal heat island was more frequent (75\% of the time for the period examined) than daytime cases (25\%). The maximum nocturnal heat island intensity, 7.8$\,^{\circ}$C was observed in a dry month (February) characterized by calm clear nights. Although less frequent, the daytime heat islands did occur and may have been caused by differences in evaporative cooling from wet surface during the wet season. Midday heat islands had a frequency of 13\% and an intensity of 3--5$\,^{\circ}$C during the wet season. The afternoon/evening heat islands had an intensity of 4--5$\,^{\circ}$C. They occurred during both dry and wet season with a frequency of 12\% of the time in a year. The average urban/rural thermal contrasts are positive throughout the year varying from 5$\,^{\circ}$C at day break in the middle of the dry season to 1--3$\,^{\circ}$C around noon during the wet months.},

	Abstract = {The radiation stresses in water waves play an important role in a variety of oceanographic phenomena, for example in the change in mean sea level due to storm waves (wave "set-up"); the generation of "surf-beats"; the interaction of waves with steady currents; and the steepening of short gravity waves on the crests of longer waves. In previous papers these effects have been discussed rigorously by detailed perturbation analysis. In the present paper a simplified exposition is given of the radiation stresses and some of their consequencies. Physical reasoning, though less rigorous, is used wherever possible. The influence of capillarity on the radiation stresses is fully described for the first time.},

@article{chuwen_divergent_2009,
	Abstract = {This study has compared the environmental characteristics of the basins and saline lower reaches of the tributaries of eight estuaries on the south coast of Western Australia, which differ in their degree of connectivity with the ocean. Although four estuaries between 115.1$\,^{\circ}$ and 121.8$\,^{\circ}$ E along that coast remain permanently open to the ocean, the others only become open when the volume of river discharge is sufficient to breach the prominent sand bars at their mouths, which occurs annually following heavy winter and early spring rainfall in some estuaries (seasonally open) and infrequently in others (normally closed). Estuaries to the west of 118.5$\,^{\circ}$ E are predominantly permanently open, e.g. Oyster Harbour, or seasonally open, e.g. Broke, Irwin and Wilson inlets, whereas those further east, e.g. Wellstead Estuary and Hamersley, Culham and Stokes inlets, where annual rainfall and thus discharge are much lower, only become open after exceptionally heavy discharge. In permanently and seasonally-open estuaries, pronounced haloclines and oxyclines are present in the narrow rivers but not the wide basins where the waters are subjected to wind-driven mixing. The extent of cyclical seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions differed markedly among the three seasonally-open estuaries and between years in one of those systems. These differences reflected variations in the relationship between the volume of fluvial discharge, which is determined by a combination of the amount of local rainfall, catchment size and extent of clearing of native vegetation, and the amount of intrusion by marine waters, which is largely controlled by the size and duration of the opening of the estuary mouth. The mean seasonal salinities in the basins of the three normally-closed estuaries increased over three years of very low rainfall to 64 in the deepest of these estuaries (Stokes Inlet) to 145 in Hamersley Inlet and to 296 in the shallowest estuary (Culham Inlet). These results demonstrate that the environmental characteristics of estuaries on the south coast of Western Australia differ markedly, even among those of the same type, e.g. seasonally-open estuaries or normally-closed estuaries.},

@article{webster_hydrodynamics_2010,
	Abstract = {The Coorong is a choked coastal lagoon in South Australia that forms part of the terminal lake system at the end of the River Murray, Australia{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s major river. It is an inverse estuary with a constricted channel connection to the sea at one end and extends parallel to the coast for more than 100{\^A} km away from this inlet. The present paper considers the physical dynamics of the Coorong, particularly its ecologically important salinity and water level regimes, and how these respond to connectedness with the ocean, barrage flows and meteorological conditions. The approach combines hydrodynamic modelling with measurements and considers temporal variation in the system ranging from seasonal to multi-decadal timescales.

The Coorong is relatively unusual in that the major freshwater input occurs through barrages much closer to the estuary mouth than to its head. Thus, the barrage flows only {\^a}€˜flush{\^a}€{\texttrademark} the Coorong between the barrages and the sea. Over most of its length, salt accumulating through evapo-concentration mixes back out of the system by fluctuating water motions caused by sea level variations propagating through the inlet channel and by wind. By scouring the inlet channel on a seasonal basis, barrage flows facilitate the penetration of sea level variations into the Coorong leading to enhanced along-lagoon mixing. Further, barrage flows freshen the waters near the seaward end of the system causing water of lower salt content than sea water to replace evaporative losses in its interior. By increasing the water depth in the system, barrage flows facilitate the exchange between the North and South Lagoons of the Coorong which are its two major basins.

The modelling supported by measurements shows how the salinity regime in the Coorong appears to have responded to multi-year cycles of variation in discharge of the River Murray over the last 50 years. Even before the present drought, which has seen salinity in the South Lagoon exceed four times sea water, the lagoon was dominantly hypersaline. The modelling suggests that the significant reductions in freshwater inflows to the Coorong due to water resource development would have caused the South Lagoon to evolve from a state of being usually brackish to marine into its present hypersaline state. The conceptual understanding of the Coorong{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s physical dynamics and their encapsulation in a hydrodynamic model are enabling strategies to be evaluated for alleviation of its present degraded condition, and for its improved future management.},

@article{baldock_simulation_1999,
	Abstract = {This paper presents numerical simulations and analytical predictions of key aspects of swash oscillations on a steep beach. Simulations of the shoreline displacement based on bore run-up theory are found to give excellent agreement with recent experimental data for regular waves, wave groups and random waves. The theory is used to derive parameters that predict the onset of swash saturation and the spectral characteristics of the saturated shoreline motion. These parameters are again in good agreement with the measured laboratory data and are also consistent with previous experimental data. Simulation of irregular wave run-up using a series of overlapping monochromatic swash events is found to reproduce typical features of swash oscillations and can accurately describe both the low and high frequency spectral characteristics of the swash zone. In particular, the low frequency components of the run-up can be modelled directly using a sequence of incident short wave bores, with no direct long wave input to the numerical simulations. This suggests that wave groupiness must be accounted for when modelling shoreline oscillations.},

Four of the five headwaters species occurred throughout the area and two of these species dominated the fauna in all areas. Thirty-one species were found in the area. Succession took the form of additions to the headwaters assemblage and replacement was of minor importance. Regression analyses show that the number of species in any area was correlated most strongly with stream depth although an effect of position was also significant. Species diversity (information theoretic) was independent of position and depended on depth alone. Behavioral observations support the importance of the depth factor.},

@article{kastner-klein_mean_2004,
	Abstract = {In this study, a detailed model of an urban landscape has been re-constructed inthe wind tunnel and the flow structure inside and above the urban canopy has beeninvestigated. Vertical profiles of all three velocity components have been measuredwith a Laser-Doppler velocimeter, and an extensive analysis of the measured meanflow and turbulence profiles carried out. With respect to the flow structure inside thecanopy, two types of velocity profiles can be distinguished. Within street canyons,the mean wind velocities are almost zero or negative below roof level, while closeto intersections or open squares, significantly higher mean velocities are observed.In the latter case, the turbulent velocities inside the canopy also tend to be higherthan at street-canyon locations. For both types, turbulence kinetic energy and shearstress profiles show pronounced maxima in the flow region immediately above rooflevel. Based on the experimental data, a shear-stress parameterization is proposed, inwhich the velocity scale, us, and length scale, zs, are based on the level and magnitude of the shear stress peak value. In order to account for a flow region inside the canopy with negligible momentum transport, a shear stress displacement height, ds, is introduced. The proposed scaling and parameterization perform well for the measured profiles and shear-stress data published in the literature. The length scales derived from the shear-stress parameterization also allowdetermination of appropriate scales for the mean wind profile. The roughnesslength, z0, and displacement height, d0, can both be described as fractions of the distance, zs - ds, between the level of the shear-stress peak and the shear-stress displacement height. This result can be interpreted in such a way that the flow only feels the zone of depth zs - ds as the roughness layer. With respect to the lower part of the canopy (z {\textless} ds) the flow behaves as a skimming flow. Correlations between the length scales zs and ds and morphometric parameters are discussed. The mean wind profiles above the urban structure follow a logarithmic windlaw. A combination of morphometric estimation methods for d0 and z0 with wind velocity measurements at a reference height, which allow calculation of the shear-stress velocity, u*, appears to be the most reliable and easiest procedure to determine mean wind profile parameters. Inside the roughnesssublayer, a local scaling approach results in good agreement between measuredand predicted mean wind profiles.},

@article{nowacki_water_2013,
	Abstract = {The muddy tidal flats of southern Willapa Bay, Washington are tidally dominated and receive little direct freshwater input. We use data from instruments deployed in channels of different size and on their adjacent flats to investigate the hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics of each morphological setting under a range of seasonal and meteorological conditions, including rain and wind events. Interaction between the morphology of the channel/flat complex and tidal water-level variations produces well-defined velocity pulses during both flooding and ebbing tides. These pulses represent about 27\% of the total along-channel water transport and 35\% of the suspended-sediment transport of the system. Maintenance of continuity produces the velocity pulse, and pulse magnitude is determined by tidal range. Wind alters the flow regime in channels and on the flat, enhancing over-flat ebb flow in this study location while decreasing ebb-pulse intensity. Wind speed was positively correlated with minimum suspended-sediment concentration. Precipitation falling directly on flats was found to erode flat sediment, which subsequently formed a temporary deposit in the adjacent channel. Residual along-channel water transport in channels and on nearby flats was flood dominant under all seasonal conditions sampled, and sediment flux was flood dominant during winter and spring deployments.},

The current study extends these findings by examining the longitudinal relations between mothers' earlier gender stereotypes and perceptions and adolescents' later math-science achievement beliefs and career choices. As predicted, mothers' earlier perceptions of their adolescents' abilities were related to adolescents' math-science self-efficacy 2 years after high school, with adolescents' self-perceptions of math ability during 10th grade mediating the relation with mothers' perceptions. Moreover, mothers' earlier predictions of their children's abilities to succeed in math careers were significantly related to later career choices.},

@article{malarkey_free-stream_2012,
	Abstract = {In shallow water, when waves shoal their orbital velocities exhibit skewness (velocity skewness) and asymmetry (acceleration skewness) in response to corresponding changes in the free surface. Near the bed, changes in the skewness and asymmetry of the time-varying velocities have important consequences for the residual velocities `spun up' by the bottom friction and for sediment transport. In the wave boundary layer, where the largest sediment transport often occurs, there is a need to represent the free-stream velocity (the orbital velocity at the edge of the wave boundary layer) in a systematic way such that it can be mimicked in wave tunnel experiments and wave boundary layer models which usually do not represent the free surface. Since there is no readily accessible dynamical theory for shoaling waves that includes both skewness and asymmetry, it is necessary to synthesize the shoaling effect in a free-stream velocity description that is general enough to fit observed velocity time series. This paper reviews previous free-stream velocity descriptions, including the description of Abreu et al. (2010), and introduces a new description based on generalising a sawtooth wave shape. The paper quantifies all the relevant measures of skewness and asymmetry for each description. It then demonstrates that Abreu et al.'s (2010) description represents the most general one and improves upon their fitting techniques to observed free-stream velocities to further simplify it. When this description is used in conjunction with a characterisation of the velocity for irregular waves, such as that of Elfrink et al. (2006), it is possible to relate velocity skewness and asymmetry directly to the non-dimensional wave and beach parameters (wave height, surface wavelength and surf similarity parameter as a proxy for beach slope). {MATLAB} scripts are provided for the improved description of Abreu et al. (2010) and Elfrink et al.'s (2006) characterisation.},

	Abstract = {Irregularities in the shoreline of an embayment act as a trap for water properties such as an introduced pollutant. The exchange of water between the trap and the main body may lead to an effective longitudinal dispersion of these properties. A mathematical model for this problem is developed, in which the exchange process between the trap and main body can be parameterized by the geometry of the system as well as by an exchange rate coefficient. In effect, the trap system behaves as a localized source-and-sink of substance for the main body of water.

The model enables us to discuss the moments of the substance distribution. It is shown that, depending upon the values of parameters chosen, the presence of a trap may enhance or suppress the rate of dispersion in the main stream. This study suggests that the entrapment phenomenon may be a process of practical importance in longitudinal dispersion of substance in estuaries and coastal waters.},

@article{green_internal_2008,
	Abstract = {The energy flux in internal waves generated at the Celtic Sea shelf break was estimated by (i) applying perturbation theory to a week-long dataset from a mooring at 200 m depth, and (ii) using a 2D non-hydrostatic circulation model over the shelf break. The dataset consisted of high resolution time-series of currents and vertical stratification together with two 25-h sets of vertical profiles of the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy. The observations indicated an average energy flux of 139 W m−1, travelling along the shelf break towards the northwest. The average energy flux across the shelf break at the mooring was only 8 W m−1. However, the waves propagating onshelf transported up to 200 W m−1, but they were only present 51\% of the time. A comparison between the divergence of the baroclinic energy flux and observed dissipation within the seasonal thermocline at the mooring showed that the dissipation was at least one order of magnitude larger. Results from a 2D model along a transect perpendicular to the shelf break showed a time-averaged onshelf energy flux of 153--425 W m−1, depending on the magnitude of the barotropic forcing. A divergence zone of the energy flux was found a few kilometre offshore of the location of the observations in the model results, and fluxes on the order of several {kW} m−1 were present in the deep waters further offshelf from the divergence zone. The modelled fluxes exhibited qualitative agreements with the phase and hourly onshelf magnitudes of the observed energy fluxes. Both the observations and the model results show an intermittent onshelf energy flux of 100--200 W m−1, but these waves could only propagate ∼20--30 km onshore before dissipating. This conclusion was supported by a 25-h dataset sampled some 180 km onto the shelf, where a weak wave energy flux was found going towards the shelf break. We therefore conclude that shelf break generated internal waves are unlikely to be the main source of energy for mixing on the inner part of the shelf.},

Near the break point, where the wave height is greater than predicted by first-order wave theory, the measured `set-down' was consistently less than theory would predict from the deep water wave height. Inside the break point the bore height was found to be a linear function of the mean water depth.

@article{le_hir_characterization_2000,
	Abstract = {The paper reviews the different physical forcings that control tidal flat hydrodynamics. Tidal propagation and cross-shore or long-shore currents, tidal asymmetry, wind-induced circulation, wave propagation and drainage processes are successively considered. Some simple methods are described for estimating cross-shore currents and wave-induced bottom shear stresses, and the results obtained are compared to field measurements on three contrasted sites in Europe. In particular the cross-shore current is shown uniform in the lower part of the flat, and decreasing towards the shore. Bottom friction-induced wave attenuation is simply formulated on gently sloping beds, leading to a maximum wave height that a flat can experience; it is proportional to the water height according to the ratio between the slope and the wave friction factor. The maximum related shear stress occurs at high water and is also proportional to the water depth. Maximum tidal velocities are very similar in the three sites where bottom sediment is muddy, suggesting a relationship between physical stresses and sediment characteristics. The consequences of physical forcings on sediment transport are listed. The bottom shear stress is suggested as the relevant parameter for comparing tidal and wave effects. In general, tide induces onshore sediment transport, whereas waves and drainage favour offshore transport. The processes leading to a possible tidal equilibrium profile are analysed: they involve the intrinsic asymmetry that favours net deposition at high water, and an ebb dominance generated by the resulting bottom profile convexity. Eroding waves are likely to upset such a balance; this equilibrium then reduces to a trend for the system.},

Some theoretical gaps in the field of tidal interaction with fjord constrictions are filled. First a theory for tidal choking in a fjord with freshwater runoff is presented. A Table is given which can be used for a quick determination of tidal choking effects in almost any fjord. Second a simple theory for internal wave generation by tides in a linearly stratified fjord is developed.

@article{davis_eutrophication_2006,
	Abstract = {Australian science has made rapid advances in the last decade in understanding eutrophication processes in inland waters and estuaries. The freshwater research on which these advances are based was triggered by well-publicised blooms of cyanobacteria during the 1980s and early 1990s, particularly a 1000 km long bloom on the Darling River. In estuaries the study which greatly enhanced our understanding but simultaneously served to stimulate further research into estuarine eutrophication, the Port Phillip Bay Study, was initially designed to address perceived problems of toxicants in the Bay but provided profound insights into drivers for, and ecosystem responses to, eutrophication. Subsequent estuarine research has largely been stimulated by management questions arising from Australia's increasing coastal development for residential purposes. The research has shown that some of the beliefs extant at the time of the blooms were incorrect. For example, it is now clear that stratification and light penetration, not nutrient availability, are the triggers for blooms in the impounded rivers of southeastern Australia, although nutrient exhaustion limits the biomass of blooms. Again, nitrogen seems to play as important a role as phosphorus does in controlling the biomass of these freshwater blooms. The research has also shown that aspects of eutrophication, such as nutrient transport, are dominated by different processes in different parts of Australia. Many of the biophysical processes involved in eutrophication have now been quantified sufficiently for models to be developed of such processes as sediment-nutrient release, stratification, turbidity and algal growth in both freshwater and estuarine systems. In some cases the models are reliable enough for the knowledge gained in particular waterbodies to be applied elsewhere. Thus, there is now a firm scientific foundation for managers to rely upon when managing algal blooms. Whilst these findings have already been presented to managers and communities throughout Australia, there is still a considerable way to go before they are absorbed into their modus operandi.},

	Abstract = {During the past decade or so, various coasts have been designated as wave-dominated or tide-dominated. Typically there is an association made between coastal morphology and the dominant process that operates on the coast in question. Most authors consider long, smooth, barrier coasts with few inlets and poorly developed ebb deltas as ``wave-dominated''. These coasts are associated with microtidal ranges. Conversely, mesotidal coasts tend to develop short, drumstick-shaped barriers with well-developed ebb deltas. They are considered as tide-dominated barriers. Such generalizations may be restricted to coasts with moderate wave energy although this is commonly not stated. Exceptions to these stated generalizations are so numerous that wave energy and tidal prism must also be included in characterizing coasts. The relative effects of waves and tides are of extreme importance. It is possible to have wave-dominated coasts with virtually any tidal range and it is likewise possible to have tide-dominated coasts even with very small ranges. The overprint of tidal prism will also produce tide-dominated morphology on coasts with microtidal ranges.},

@article{wilson_sediment_2012,
	Abstract = {Tsunamis have caused significant damage to boats and docks within harbors and ports along the California coast. Sediment scour and deposition within harbors by tsunamis, though not extensively studied, have produced long-term impacts to the recovery and resiliency of affected maritime communities. The March 11, 2011 Tohoku-oki teletsunami generated strong tsunami currents (up to 7 m/s, or 14 kn) within Crescent City and Santa Cruz harbors that triggered sedimentation problems, regulatory issues with sediment disposal, and months of delays in the reconstruction process. Evaluation of video, pre- and post-tsunami bathymetric surveys, and harbor sediment analysis data helped develop a better understanding of tsunami flow regime and sediment transport within these harbors. In Crescent City, the scour effects of large tsunami surges were amplified by the narrow entrance to the Small-Boat Basin, increasing the sediment supply and trapping this material within the basin, causing shoaling that made the harbor unusable and creating long-term disposal issues. Within the entire harbor, at least 289,400 m3 of sediment was scoured in an area of 0.67 km2. A minimum fill volume of 154,600 m3 was calculated with the sediment covering 55\% of that portion of the harbor included in the bathymetric surveys. In Santa Cruz, the long, constricting layout and shallow nature of the harbor increased current velocities and scour in confined areas, and exacerbated sedimentation in between and beneath docks. At the harbor entrance, estimated scour volumes range from 2550 to 14,800 m3, and fill estimates range from 120 to 8750 m3, depending upon the surveys used to characterize post-tsunami conditions, while the area of deposition ranges from 6 to 64\% of the survey overlap areas. About 83 m3 of sediment was scoured in Santa Cruz North Harbor, while a minimum of 75 m3 was deposited across 50\% of that portion of the harbor common to pre- and post-tsunami surveys. Fill estimates are considered minimums, due to sediment deposited in locales not covered by the various surveys. In general, the southern part of the harbor near the entrance jetties was erosional while most of the northern part of the harbor was depositional. Analyses of tsunami currents observed on videos collected during the tsunami provide excellent support for the bathymetric change analyses, and together the two lines of evidence provide a means to predict flow patterns and areas at risk of damage from the tsunami by assessing harbor dimensions and layout, and analyzing observations/video from past tsunamis. Reducing constrictions and deepening channels within harbors would greatly reduce tsunami current speeds and the potential for scour. The maritime community and state regulatory agencies should work together to streamline the review process to assist recovery efforts after significant tsunamis.},

@article{burchard_combined_2009,
	Abstract = {The aim of this one-dimensional water column study is to combine modified versions of three characteristic parameters for periodic tidal flow under the influence of a longitudinal buoyancy gradient---the horizontal Richardson number, the inverse Strouhal number, and the inverse Ekman number---into a parameter space study, including constant wind forcing from various directions. It is shown how the underlying dynamical equations can be cast into nondimensional form, depending mainly on these three nondimensional parameters plus the relative wind speed and the wind direction. Idealized model simulations are carried out for the whole realistic range of horizontal Richardson and inverse Strouhal numbers for various latitudes, showing the amplitude of the tidally induced stratification for a wide range of scenarios. It is found that classical threshold values for the horizontal Richardson number, indicating the switch from periodic stratification to permanent stratification, are valid only for special cases, and that this switch also strongly depends on the inverse Strouhal number, the inverse Ekman number, and the wind vector. The transverse residual flow is close to the thermal wind balance for a variety of parameters, and nondimensionalized longitudinal residual flow shows the classical estuarine exchange flow pattern with little variation in the near-bed onshore component. Wind straining is confirmed as an important estuarine and coastal process, enhancing estuarine circulation for offshore (down estuary) winds and vice versa. Agreement with field data from Liverpool Bay is good, including the explanation of a flood tide local maximum of the dissipation rate in the upper half of the water column. An equation for the second time derivative of the potential energy anomaly is derived for quantifying the dynamical processes leading to stratification due to the straining of the horizontal density gradient.

@article{uncles_infragravity_2014,
	Abstract = {Observations are presented of estuarine infragravity oscillations in a very small estuary, the R{\'\i}a de Santiuste, northern Spain, that discharges into a bay. Time-scale calculations and measurements indicate that the most likely source of amplified infragravity waves within the estuary are coastal edge waves, which appear to be resonating between the headlands of the bay, and onshore-offshore seiching of waters that may be resonating between the beach and the bay's seaward limit. Infragravity waves in the estuary have a narrow, power-dominant periodicity range of 4.3--4.8 min. Generally, only very weak waves, and at other periodicities, occur within the tidal river when it is unaffected by the tide. Although infragravity water-level amplitudes are small in the tidal river, typically ∼0.01 m during high water, the corresponding velocity amplitudes are significant, typically ∼0.1 m s−1, despite the occurrence of high runoff conditions during these measurements. Within the estuary and close to the mouth, near-bed salinity shows considerable variability that is a consequence of salt wedge oscillations with periodicities that are within the range of 4.3--4.8 min. Model results for simulated neap to spring high-water water levels show that wave periodicities in the range 3.5--4.5 min correspond approximately to 3λ/4 resonances. The model also indicates that an effect of low runoff is to greatly enhance resonant behaviour within the estuary, such that water level amplitudes of 0.02 m at the mouth can produce wave currents as fast as 0.4 m s−1 within the estuary, compared with ∼0.1 m s−1 during high runoff.},

@article{warner_development_2010,
	Abstract = {Understanding the processes responsible for coastal change is important for managing our coastal resources, both natural and economic. The current scientific understanding of coastal sediment transport and geology suggests that examining coastal processes at regional scales can lead to significant insight into how the coastal zone evolves. To better identify the significant processes affecting our coastlines and how those processes create coastal change we developed a Coupled Ocean--Atmosphere--Wave--Sediment Transport ({COAWST}) Modeling System, which is comprised of the Model Coupling Toolkit to exchange data fields between the ocean model {ROMS}, the atmosphere model {WRF}, the wave model {SWAN}, and the sediment capabilities of the Community Sediment Transport Model. This formulation builds upon previous developments by coupling the atmospheric model to the ocean and wave models, providing one-way grid refinement in the ocean model, one-way grid refinement in the wave model, and coupling on refined levels. Herein we describe the modeling components and the data fields exchanged. The modeling system is used to identify model sensitivity by exchanging prognostic variable fields between different model components during an application to simulate Hurricane Isabel during September 2003. Results identify that hurricane intensity is extremely sensitive to sea surface temperature. Intensity is reduced when coupled to the ocean model although the coupling provides a more realistic simulation of the sea surface temperature. Coupling of the ocean to the atmosphere also results in decreased boundary layer stress and coupling of the waves to the atmosphere results in increased bottom stress. Wave results are sensitive to both ocean and atmospheric coupling due to wave--current interactions with the ocean and wave growth from the atmosphere wind stress. Sediment resuspension at regional scale during the hurricane is controlled by shelf width and wave propagation during hurricane approach.},

@article{baldock_sediment_2010,
	Abstract = {New laboratory data are presented on the influence of free long waves, bound long waves and wave groups on sediment transport in the surf and swash zones. As a result of the very significant difficulties in isolating and identifying the morphodynamic influences of long waves and wave groups in field conditions, a laboratory study was designed specifically to enable measurements of sediment transport that resolve these influences. The evolution of model sand beaches, each with the same initial plane slope, was measured for a range of wave conditions, firstly using monochromatic short waves. Subsequently, the monochromatic conditions were perturbed with free long waves and then substituted with bichromatic wave groups with the same mean energy flux. The beach profile changes and net cross-shore transport rates were extracted and compared for the different wave conditions, with and without long waves and wave groups. The experiments include a range of wave conditions, e.g. high-energy, moderate-energy, low-energy waves, which induce both spilling and plunging breakers and different turbulent intensities, and the beaches evolve to form classical accretive, erosive, and intermediate beach states. The data clearly demonstrate that free long waves influence surf zone morphodynamics and promote increased onshore sediment transport during accretive conditions and decreased offshore transport under erosive conditions. In contrast, wave groups, which can generate both forced and free long waves, generally reduce onshore transport during accretive conditions and increase offshore transport under erosive conditions. The influence of the free long waves and wave groups is consistent with the concept of the relative fall velocity, H/{wsT}, as a dominant parameter controlling net beach erosion or accretion. Free long waves tend to reduce H/{wsT}, promoting accretion, while wave groups tend to increase the effective H/{wsT}, promoting erosion.},

@article{friedrichs_non-linear_1988,
	Abstract = {The importance of asymmetric tidal cycles in the transport and accumulation of sediment in shallow well-mixed estuaries is well established. Along the U.S. Atlantic Coast, tidal amplitude, bottom friction, and system geometry determine tidal distortion as documented at 54 tide gauges in 26 tidally dominated estuaries of varying geometry having negligible freshwater inflow. Analyses of sea-surface heights are compared to the results of one-dimensional numerical modelling to clarify the physics of tidal response in well-mixed estuaries. Concise measurements of estuarine geometry and ocean tidal range are used to predict consistently the nature of tidal sea-surface distortion. Numerical modelling then is utilized to extend theoretical and observational relationships between geometry and sea-height to predict trends in velocity distortion and near-bed sediment transport. Non-linear tidal distortion is a composite of two principal effects: (1) frictional interaction between the tide and channel bottoms (reflected in a/h = tidal amplitude/channel depth) causes relatively shorter floods; (2) intertidal storage (measured by Vs/Vc = volume of intertidal storage/volume of channels at mean sea level) causes relatively shorter ebbs. Variations in Vs/Vc and a/h trigger consistent and predictable changes in tidal distortion as measured through the first harmonic of the principal tidal constitutent.},

The method assumes a linear tide gauge response to external forcing and is based on comparative analysis of tsunami and background spectra. Evaluation of the ratio of tsunami to background spectra gives functional characteristics that are invariant of station location and dependent only on the source parameters. Three events, the Urup tsunami of December 22, 1991 (northwest Pacific), the Hokkaido Southwest (Okushiri) tsunami of July 12, 1993 (Sea of Japan), and the Shikotan tsunami of October 4, 1994 (northwest Pacific), are used as examples of the proposed approach. The source spectra reconstructed from the analysis of different tide gauges were found to be in good agreement with each other and with the seismological, geodetic, and field survey data.},

@article{mackay_mixing_1990,
	Abstract = {In the winter of 1987, a field exercise of 6 weeks' duration was carried out to investigate tidal dynamics and circulation patterns in the Sundays River estuary, on the south-east coast of South Africa. Measurements included continuous monitoring of water levels inside and outside the estuary, salinity and temperature profiles along the estuary at slack tides, current velocity profiles and near-bottom currents. The estuary was found to be in a highly stratified state at neap tides, but became completely mixed at spring tides. Dynamically, it can be divided into four longitudinal sections, each with an essentially different circulation pattern. Stratification and mixing in the water column appears to depend on: (a) semidiurnal tides in the local coastal ocean; (b) the spring-neap tidal cycle; (c) freshwater input. Direct effects of wind mixing were not observed. Frequent visual observations of the phenomenon of axial convergence are supported by water temperature and current velocity data.},

@article{cooper_geomorphological_2001,
	Abstract = {Over 300 independent river outlets exist around the microtidal, wave-dominated South African coast. Most of these are located in drowned river valley settings and have acquired their present morphology during the Holocene marine transgression. A variety of geomorphological forms are identified in these estuaries that result from variation in antecedent topography, fluvial sediment supply and marine sediment supply. Five distinctive estuary types are identified on the basis of contemporary morphodynamics. These are categorised into three types of normally open estuary (that maintain a semi-permanent connection with the open sea) and two types of normally closed estuary, which are separated from the sea for long periods by a continuous supratidal barrier. The contemporary morphodynamics and sedimentary environments of each estuary type are discussed.

Open estuaries include barrier--inlet systems maintained by fluvial discharge (termed river-dominated estuaries) and tidal discharge (termed tide-dominated estuaries). A third category of open estuary lacks a supratidal barrier due to inadequate marine sediment availability. Closed estuaries receive marine influence via barrier overwash and occasional breaching but are typically enclosed behind a continuous supratidal barrier. Two categories of closed estuary are identified: perched and non-perched. Perched estuaries develop behind high berms and maintain a water level above high tide level in the open sea. They are often dominated by fresh to brackish water and breach and drain periodically. Non-perched estuaries are developed behind low-elevation barriers fronted by wide dissipative beach profiles. High overwash frequency introduces marine water into such systems. Breaching of such estuaries does not produce dramatic draining as the water level may only drop according to the stage of the open sea tidal cycle.

The variety of estuary types suggests several potential pathways may exist in estuarine development and that the progressive infilling model is an over simplification.},

@article{fast_meteorological_1998,
	Abstract = {Meteorological processes associated with inhomogeneous ozone concentrations over Mexico City are examined by using observations from a recent field campaign and a mesoscale dynamics and dispersion modeling system. During this 4-week field campaign, meteorological measurements of the spatial flow structure within the Mexico City basin were obtained for the first time. A mesoscale model that employs four-dimensional data assimilation is used to create analyses that describe the boundary layer characteristics and local and regional circulations in the vicinity of Mexico City. The mesoscale analyses are then used to drive a Lagrangian particle dispersion model to simulate pollutant transport and diffusion. The resemblance between the calculated particle concentration fields and the observed spatial ozone patterns indicates that the mesoscale analyses, based on the model and the observed profiles of wind, temperature, and humidity, captured the main flow features responsible for the inhomogeneous ozone concentrations within the basin. The highest particle concentrations usually occurred in the vicinity of the peak ozone concentrations during the afternoon. The observations and mesoscale analyses provided evidence that the circulations are highly complex, and relatively weak upper level synoptic systems had an impact on the local and regional thermally driven flows in the area. In addition to horizontal advection and vertical diffusion, vertical wind shears, recirculation patterns associated with venting and entrainment processes, and mean vertical motions due to convergence within the basin also played an important role in producing the spatial variations in the near-surface particle distributions. The contribution of emissions from the previous day was found to be relatively minor for the periods examined in this study, even though the nocturnal wind speeds were light, suggesting that the high ozone concentrations are not due to multiday accumulation of pollutants.},

@article{morison_changing_2012,
	Abstract = {Freshening in the Canada basin of the Arctic Ocean began in the 1990s and continued to at least the end of 2008. By then, the Arctic Ocean might have gained four times as much fresh water as comprised the Great Salinity Anomalyof the 1970s, raising the spectre of slowing global ocean circulation. Freshening has been attributed to increased sea ice melting and contributions from runoff, but a leading explanation has been a strengthening of the Beaufort High---a characteristic peak in sea level atmospheric pressure---which tends to accelerate an anticyclonic (clockwise) wind pattern causing convergence of fresh surface water. Limited observations have made this explanation difficult to verify, and observations of increasing freshwater content under a weakened Beaufort High suggest that other factors must be affecting freshwater content. Here we use observations to show that during a time of record reductions in ice extent from 2005 to 2008, the dominant freshwater content changes were an increase in the Canada basin balanced by a decrease in the Eurasian basin. Observations are drawn from satellite data (sea surface height and ocean-bottom pressure) and in situ data. The freshwater changes were due to a cyclonic (anticlockwise) shift in the ocean pathway of Eurasian runoff forced by strengthening of the west-to-east Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation characterized by an increased Arctic Oscillation index. Our results confirm that runoff is an important influence on the Arctic Ocean and establish that the spatial and temporal manifestations of the runoff pathways are modulated by the Arctic Oscillation, rather than the strength of the wind-driven Beaufort Gyre circulation.},

@article{ganju_hindcasting_2009,
	Abstract = {Hindcasting decadal-timescale bathymetric change in estuaries is prone to error due to limited data for initial conditions, boundary forcing, and calibration; computational limitations further hinder efforts. We developed and calibrated a tidal-timescale model to bathymetric change in Suisun Bay, California, over the 1867--1887 period. A general, multiple-timescale calibration ensured robustness over all timescales; two input reduction methods, the morphological hydrograph and the morphological acceleration factor, were applied at the decadal timescale. The model was calibrated to net bathymetric change in the entire basin; average error for bathymetric change over individual depth ranges was 37\%. On a model cell-by-cell basis, performance for spatial amplitude correlation was poor over the majority of the domain, though spatial phase correlation was better, with 61\% of the domain correctly indicated as erosional or depositional. Poor agreement was likely caused by the specification of initial bed composition, which was unknown during the 1867--1887 period. Cross-sectional bathymetric change between channels and flats, driven primarily by wind wave resuspension, was modeled with higher skill than longitudinal change, which is driven in part by gravitational circulation. The accelerated response of depth may have prevented gravitational circulation from being represented properly. As performance criteria became more stringent in a spatial sense, the error of the model increased. While these methods are useful for estimating basin-scale sedimentation changes, they may not be suitable for predicting specific locations of erosion or deposition. They do, however, provide a foundation for realistic estuarine geomorphic modeling applications.},

@article{hemer_projected_2013,
	Abstract = {Future changes in wind-wave climate have broad implications for the operation and design of coastal, near- and off-shore industries and ecosystems, and may further exacerbate the anticipated vulnerabilities of coastal regions to projected sea-level rise. However, wind waves have received little attention in global assessments of projected future climate change. We present results from the first community-derived multi-model ensemble of wave-climate projections. We find an agreed projected decrease in annual mean significant wave height ({HS}) over 25.8\% of the global ocean area. The area of projected decrease is greater during boreal winter (January--March, mean; 38.5\% of the global ocean area) than austral winter (July--September, mean; 8.4\%). A projected increase in annual mean {HS} is found over 7.1\% of the global ocean, predominantly in the Southern Ocean, which is greater during austral winter (July--September; 8.8\%). Increased Southern Ocean wave activity influences a larger proportion of the global ocean as swell propagates northwards into the other ocean basins, observed as an increase in annual mean wave period ({TM}) over 30.2\% of the global ocean and associated rotation of the annual mean wave direction (θM). The multi-model ensemble is too limited to systematically sample total uncertainty associated with wave-climate projections. However, variance of wave-climate projections associated with study methodology dominates other sources of uncertainty (for example, climate scenario and model uncertainties).},

@article{geyer_reassessment_1992,
	Abstract = {The role of tidal dispersion is reassessed, based on a consideration of the relevant physical mechanisms, particularly those elucidated by numerical simulations of tide-induced dispersion. It appears that the principal influence of tidal currents on dispersion occurs at length scales of the tidal excursion and smaller; thus the effectiveness of tidal dispersion depends on the relative scale of the tidal excursion to the spacing between major bathymetric and shoreline features. In estuaries where the typical spacing of topographic features is less than the tidal excursion, tidal dispersion may contribute significantly to the overall flushing. In estuaries and embayments in which the typical spacing between major features is larger than the tidal excursion, the influence of tidal dispersion will be localized, and it will not markedly contribute to overall flushing. Tidal dispersion is most pronounced in regions of abrupt topographic changes such as headlands and inlets, where flow separation occurs. The strong strain rate in the region of flow separation tends to stretch patches of fluid into long filaments, which are subsequently rolled up and distorted by the transient eddy field. The dispersion process accomplished by the tides varies strongly as a function of position and tidal phase and thus does not lend itself to parameterization by an eddy diffusion coefficient.},

@article{largier_seasonally_1997,
	Abstract = {Data collected in three Californian estuaries indicate that hypersaline conditions exist during the dry summers typical of a Mediterranean climate. The generalised seasonal and longitudinal hydrographic structures are described and explained. It is argued that this seasonal hypersalinity is common and that it represents a major class of estuaries. The observed accumulation of salt indicates surprisingly long residence times in small basins which have free exchange with the ocean. This semi-isolation of the inner basin leads to a large build-up or severe depletion of nutrients, pollutants and plankton in these systems. Of concern are the trends to increase pollutant loading in the same systems that are experiencing an increase in residence times owing to freshwater extraction in the watershed.},

@article{olabarrieta_oceanatmosphere_2012,
	Abstract = {The coupled ocean--atmosphere--wave--sediment transport ({COAWST}) modeling system was used to investigate atmosphere--ocean--wave interactions in November 2009 during Hurricane Ida and its subsequent evolution to Nor'Ida, which was one of the most costly storm systems of the past two decades. One interesting aspect of this event is that it included two unique atmospheric extreme conditions, a hurricane and a nor'easter storm, which developed in regions with different oceanographic characteristics. Our modeled results were compared with several data sources, including {GOES} satellite infrared data, {JASON}-1 and {JASON}-2 altimeter data, {CODAR} measurements, and wave and tidal information from the National Data Buoy Center ({NDBC}) and the National Tidal Database. By performing a series of numerical runs, we were able to isolate the effect of the interaction terms between the atmosphere (modeled with Weather Research and Forecasting, the {WRF} model), the ocean (modeled with Regional Ocean Modeling System ({ROMS})), and the wave propagation and generation model (modeled with Simulating Waves Nearshore ({SWAN})). Special attention was given to the role of the ocean surface roughness. Three different ocean roughness closure models were analyzed: {DGHQ} (which is based on wave age), {TY}2001 (which is based on wave steepness), and {OOST} (which considers both the effects of wave age and steepness). Including the ocean roughness in the atmospheric module improved the wind intensity estimation and therefore also the wind waves, surface currents, and storm surge amplitude. For example, during the passage of Hurricane Ida through the Gulf of Mexico, the wind speeds were reduced due to wave-induced ocean roughness, resulting in better agreement with the measured winds. During Nor'Ida, including the wave-induced surface roughness changed the form and dimension of the main low pressure cell, affecting the intensity and direction of the winds. The combined wave age- and wave steepness-based parameterization ({OOST}) provided the best results for wind and wave growth prediction. However, the best agreement between the measured ({CODAR}) and computed surface currents and storm surge values was obtained with the wave steepness-based roughness parameterization ({TY}2001), although the differences obtained with respect to {DGHQ} were not significant. The influence of sea surface temperature ({SST}) fields on the atmospheric boundary layer dynamics was examined; in particular, we evaluated how the {SST} affects wind wave generation, surface currents and storm surges. The integrated hydrograph and integrated wave height, parameters that are highly correlated with the storm damage potential, were found to be highly sensitive to the ocean surface roughness parameterization.},

Approximately 400 parents and their 6th- to 11th-grade children responded to questionnaires concerning their beliefs about the child's mathematics achievement and their stereotypes about males' and females' relative abilities in mathematics. Path analyses revealed that parents' gender stereotypes have no direct effect on children's self-perceptions. Instead, parents' stereotypes interact with the sex of their child to directly influence the parents' beliefs about the child's abilities. In turn, parents' beliefs about their child directly influence their child's self-perceptions, and both the parents' stereotypes and the child's self-perceptions influence the child's performance.},

	Abstract = {The measurement of water wave characteristics, such as wavelength and wave height, in the surf zone is important for monitoring, prediction of erosion, and numerical model calibration. Traditional methods of measuring wave heights have either been limited to a small number of points or have required contact with the water. An experimental study of the remote sensing of water wave elevations, through the application of stereo photogrammetry, is presented. This method uses two spatially offset cameras, with overlapping fields of view, to determine water surface elevation. This remote sensing approach provides data with excellent spatial coverage and spatial and temporal resolution. Additionally, the hardware needs are minimal and the system is quickly deployed, calibrated, and operational.

In the present study, a phased approach was taken, with medium scale (domain {\textasciitilde}\&\#xa0;50\&\#xa0;m2) laboratory experiments being followed by a large scale (domain {\textasciitilde}\&\#xa0;103--\&\#xa0;104\&\#xa0;m2) field test of the method. In the laboratory, reconstructed surface elevations were validated using a pressure sensor and demonstrated excellent agreement. In the field, measured wave heights and periods were found to agree well with available buoy data.},

@article{aagaard_role_1989,
	Abstract = {Salinity stratification is critical to the vertical circulation of the high-latitude ocean. We here examine the control of the vertical circulation in the northern seas, and the potential for altering it, by considering the budgets and storage of fresh water in the Arctic Ocean and in the convective regions to the south. We find that the present-day Greenland and Iceland seas, and probably also the Labrador Sea, are rather delicately poised with respect to their ability to sustain convection. Small variations in the fresh water supplied to the convective gyres from the Arctic Ocean via the East Greenland Current can alter or stop the convection in what may be a modern analog to the halocline catastrophes proposed for the distant past. The North Atlantic salinity anomaly of the 1960s and 1970s is a recent example; it must have had its origin in an increased fresh water discharge from the Arctic Ocean. Similarly, the freshening and cooling of the deep North Atlantic in recent years is a likely manifestation of the increased transfer of fresh water from the Arctic Ocean into the convective gyres. Finally, we note that because of the temperature dependence of compressibility, a slight salinity stratification in the convective gyres is required to efficiently ventilate the deep ocean.},

	Abstract = {A third-generation numerical wave model to compute random, short-crested waves in coastal regions with shallow water and ambient currents (Simulating Waves Nearshore ({SWAN})) has been developed, implemented, and validated. The model is based on a Eulerian formulation of the discrete spectral balance of action density that accounts for refractive propagation over arbitrary bathymetry and current fields. It is driven by boundary conditions and local winds. As in other third-generation wave models, the processes of wind generation, whitecapping, quadruplet wave-wave interactions, and bottom dissipation are represented explicitly. In {SWAN}, triad wave-wave interactions and depth-induced wave breaking are added. In contrast to other third-generation wave models, the numerical propagation scheme is implicit, which implies that the computations are more economic in shallow water. The model results agree well with analytical solutions, laboratory observations, and (generalized) field observations.},

@article{fonseca_influence_1982,
	Abstract = {A salt-water flume was used to describe the mechanics of current flow around an articial Zostera marina meadow. Shear velocity and roughness height were positively correlated with seagrass surface area, and were positively/negatively correlated with current velocity. Current velocity intrusion into the meadow before diminution and maximum reduction (both at the 2 cm height line) proceed by factors of 1·25 and 2·07 cm into the meadow per cm s−1 of current velocity, respectively.

Froude number was correlated with mean bending angle of the canopy as a whole. Maximum bending had occurred with Froude = 1, but most bending had taken place by Froude = 0·4, a velocity of 40--50 cm s−1 in this experiment.

The meadow edge is the most dynamic zone of a seagrass meadow in regard to current flow. Bending of the shoot canopy is a mechanism for re-direction of current flow and in-canopy reduction of current velocity. Meadow dimensions may be regulated by scouring processes in different hydraulic regimes. Shoot bending and subsequent in-meadow current velocity reduction are mechanisms that affect self-shading and photosynthetic capabilities as well as providing habitat stability.},

@article{kwadijk_using_2010,
	Abstract = {Studies on the impact of climate change and sea level rise usually take climate scenarios as their starting point. To support long-term water management planning in the Netherlands, we carried out a study that started at the opposite end of the effect chain. In the study we refer to three aspects of water management, flood defense, drinking water supply, and protection of the Rotterdam Harbour. We examined whether, and for how long, current water management strategies will continue to be effective under different climate change scenarios. We did this by applying the concept of `adaptation tipping points', and reached it if the magnitude of change is such that the current management strategy can no longer meet its objectives. Beyond the tipping points, an alternative adaptive strategy is needed. By applying this approach, the following basic questions of decision makers are answered: what are the first issues that we will face as a result of climate change and when can we expect this. The results show, for instance, that climate change and the rise in sea level are more likely to cause a threat to the fresh water supply in the west of the Netherlands than flooding. Expressing uncertainty in terms of the period that the existing strategy is effective (when will a critical point be reached) was found to be useful for the policy makers. {\copyright} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

Furthermore, the theoretical ratios between power in the free surface elevation and in each velocity component of edge waves, agree with those observed, and a nonlinear shallow-water model shows edge waves of various modes propagating along the shore near our observation location.

@article{ranasinghe_flushing_1998,
	Abstract = {The seasonal closure of tidal inlets is a common feature in microtidal, wave dominated regions where streamflows and/or longshore sediment transport are highly seasonal. This closure of the inlet obstructs navigation and deteriorates the flushing mechanism of the estuary/lagoon connected to the inlet, which could result in a degradation of the water quality. This paper presents results of a numerical study undertaken at Wilson Inlet, which is a seasonally open tidal inlet situated along the south western coast of Australia. The objectives of the study were to determine the dominant processes that govern the flushing rate (i.e. tidal exchange, wind, streamflow etc.), to test the response of the flushing characteristics of the estuary to different management options and to obtain a quantitative and qualitative estimate of the flushing rate of the estuary under different conditions. The results of the study indicate that streamflow is the major influence governing the flushing of the estuary while tidal exchange, wind and entrance channel location have a minimal effect. Regions of high residence times (low flushing rates) exist along the eastern and southern boundaries of the estuary. Under high streamflow conditions sea water does not propagate into the deeper parts of the estuary as the intrusion that forces into the estuary during flood periods is flushed out by the following ebb period. However, when the streamflow is less than the mean annual streamflow seawater propagates into the deeper parts of the estuary and is not flushed out by the ebbing tides.},

	Abstract = {Changes in the amount and timing of the discharge of major Eurasian Arctic rivers have been well documented, but whether or not these changes can be attributed to climatic factors or to the construction of manmade reservoirs remains unclear. Here we endeavor to identify the key processes (snow cover and air temperature) that have regulated seasonal streamflow fluctuations in the Eurasian Arctic over the last half-century (1958--1999) and to understand the regional coherence of timing trends, using a set of Eurasian Arctic rivers selected specifically because they are free of known effects of dams. We find a shift toward earlier onset of spring runoff as measured by a modest change in the spring pulse onset (26 of 45 stations) and a strong change in the centroid of timing (39 of 45 stations). Winter streamflows increased over the period of record in most rivers, suggesting that trends observed by others in larger regulated Eurasian Arctic rivers may not be entirely attributable to reservoir construction. Upward trends in air temperature appeared to have had the largest impact on spring and summer flows for tributaries in the coldest of the major Eurasian Arctic river basins (e.g., the Lena). While the overall duration of snow cover has not significantly changed across the Eurasian Arctic, snow cover disappearance has trended earlier in the year and appears to be related to the increased May and snowmelt season fractional flows.},

When combined with wave measurements along a cross-shore transect and nearby wind measurements, the dataset provides direct estimates of the terms in simplified equations for alongshore momentum and turbulence energetics and permits examination of semiempirical relationships between bottom stress and near-bottom velocity. The records are dominated by three events when the measurement site was in the outer part of the surf zone.

	Abstract = {We have studied bed friction and water exchange in a small, almost enclosed, shallow lagoon in Sri Lanka, where both tides and freshwater supply are important for the circulation. Because of the narrow entrance, the lagoon is strongly choked for semidiurnal tidal forcing (the choking coefficient is 0.25). A set of tide gauges positioned on each side of the entrance channel was used to calculate bed friction. Measurements made over three short periods having different freshwater supply to the lagoon indicate an average friction (drag) coefficient C$_{\textrm{ D}}$ = 0.0041 $\pm$ 0.0002 (using a quadratic friction law). A comparison between observed and calculated velocities in the channel for a variety of velocities, indicates that the quadratic friction law is a good tool for parameterization. High freshwater supply increases the lagoonal sea level substantially and decreases the residence time.},

	Abstract = {A limitation in predictive capability in South Africa is the lack of predictive tools to simulate hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes in small stratified or partially stratified estuaries. Investigations on the applicability of available three-dimensional (3D) numerical models, in this case Ihe {DELFT}3D-{FLOW} model, were undertaken using the Kromme and Palmiet estuaries as case studies. Of particular importance in these small stratified or partially stratified systems is the accurate simulation of the vertical mixing and entrainment processes as these are important determinants of the flushing rates and water quality in these estuaries. In both of the above case studies, the 3D model simulations accurately reproduced the major features of these stratified systems for a month or more, particularly the flushing rates. However, the significant computational effort required for 3D models typically restricts the simulations to monthly (i.e. event scales) or seasonal time scales. This paper concludes that a predictive capability, based on 3D hydrodynamic models, can be implemented for small stratified and partially stratified estuaries. The planned implementation of a similar 3D water quality model will further enhance the capability to predict the consequences of estuarine management strategies in such estuaries.},

In the time-averaged equations of energy and momentum the energy flux, radiation stress and energy dissipation are determined by simple approximations which include the effect of the surface roller in the breaker and the actual shape of the waves. To the first approximation the roller represents a volume of water moving with the wave speed. It significantly changes both energy flux and radiation stress of the surf zone waves. The equations of energy and momentum are solved simultaneously to give the wave height variation and the set-up. Comparison with measurements shows good agreement. Also the transitions immediately after breaking are analyzed and shown to be in accordance with the above-mentioned ideas and results.},

@article{alber_conceptual_2002,
	Abstract = {As humans continue to influence the quantity, timing, and quality of freshwater input to estuaries, it is becoming increasingly common for policies to be enacted that mandate the establishment of freshwater inflow criteria that will serve to preserve and protect estuarine ecosystems. This paper reviews the scientific literature describing how changes in freshwater inflow affect estuaries, proposes a conceptual model that explores the roles of scientists, citizens, politicians, and managers in the management of freshwater inflow to estuaries, and uses the model to explore the ways in which freshwater inflow is managed in a variety of estuaries. The scientific review is organized to provide an overview of the connections between freshwater inflow (in terms of the quantity, quality, and timing of water delivery), estuarine conditions (such as salinity and concentrations of dissolved and particulate material), and estuarine resources (such as the distribution and abundance of organisms), and to highlight our understanding of the causative mechanisms that underlie the relationships among these variables. The premise of the conceptual model is that the goal of estuarine freshwater inflow policy is to protect those resources and functions that we as a society value in estuaries, and that management measures use scientific information about the relationships among inflow, conditions, and resources to establish inflow standards that can meet this goal. The management approach can be inflow-based (flow is kept within some prescribed bounds under the assumption that taking too much away is bad for the resources), condition-based (inflow standards are set in order to maintain specified conditions in the estuary), or resource-based (inflow standards are set based on the requirements of specific resources), but each of these is carried out by regulating inflow. This model is used as a framework to describe the development of freshwater inflow criteria for estuaries in Texas, Florida, and California.},

@article{green_review_2014,
	Abstract = {Waves are fundamentally important to the physical and biological functioning of estuaries. Understanding and predicting contaminant transport, development of sedimentary structures, geomorphological response to changes in external forcings such as rising sea level, and response of estuarine ecosystems to contaminant stressors require understanding of the relative roles of wave- and current-driven sediment transport. We review wave-driven sediment resuspension and transport in estuaries, including generation of bed shear stress by waves, initiation of sediment motion by waves, and the ways waves modulate, add to, and interact with sediment transport driven by currents. A key characteristic of the wave-induced force on the seabed is extreme spatial and temporal variations; simple analytical models are revealing of the way such patterns develop. Statistical methods have been widely applied to predict wave resuspension of intertidal-flat bed sediments, and physically based predictors of resuspension developed from open-coast studies appear to also apply to short-period estuarine waves. There is ample experimental evidence to conclude that over the long term, waves erode and tidal currents accrete intertidal flats. Waves indirectly add to the formation of fluid mud by adding to the estuarine pool of fine sediment, and waves may fluidize subtidal seabeds, changing bed erodibility. Models have been used to explore the dynamic balance between sediment transport by waves and by currents and have revealed the key control of waves on estuarine morphology. Estuarine intertidal flats are excellent natural laboratories that offer opportunities for working on a number of fundamental problems in sediment transport.},

@article{linden_modulated_1988,
	Abstract = {This paper describes some laboratory experiments on the circulation produced in a fluid containing a horizontal density gradient in the presence of environmental turbulence whose level varies periodically with time. The experiments are intended to model the effects of turbulence generated by tidal flow in a shallow sea or estuary. At times of high tidal flow the water column is vertically mixed and the baroclinically driven circulation is weak. At low turbulence levels the baroclinic circulation accelerates and the water column stratifies. The longitudinal flux of density is measured and an effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient K is calculated. The value {ofK} increases with the horizontal density gradient and also with the period of the turbulence modulation. This latter increase is a result of the enhanced flux driven by the baroclinic circulation at low turbulence levels. The results of these experiments are compared with some recent measurements of episodic mixing events in Liverpool Bay, U.K., Spencer Gulf, South Australia, and the Columbia River Estuary, U.S.A.},

	Abstract = {The examination of hypoxia in the hypolimnion of large lakes traditionally focuses on the assessment of its spatial and temporal extent and its effect on water quality. In Lake Erie, hypoxia typically occurs between July and October in the central basin; however, there is considerable interannual variability both spatially and temporally. The processes driving this interannual variability as well as the small-scale time variation in oxygen depletion (e.g., −0.7 to +0.3 mg L−1 d−1) were examined in a field study conducted in the western part of the central basin of Lake Erie in 2008 and 2009. Data were obtained from a spatial array of moorings as well as sampling cruises that examined the physical and biological conditions needed to investigate the dynamics of the oxygen depletion and create a vertical oxygen budget. The flux of oxygen through the thermocline to the hypolimnion was a significant source of oxygen equivalent to ∼18\% of the total oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion over the stratified period. The total oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion was due to equivalent amounts of hypolimnetic oxygen demand due to respiration in the water column and flux of oxygen to the bottom due to sediment oxygen demand. This latter finding was strongly dependent on hypolimnion thickness in Lake Erie, which also appeared to be an important parameter driving the rate of oxygen depletion by controlling the vertical volumetric fluxes and hence the competition between vertical flux and community respiration in the hypolimnion of shallow lakes.},

@article{fonseca_influence_1998,
	Abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: Field surveys were conducted in Core and Back Sounds, North Carolina, {USA}, to relate the physical setting of seagrass beds, as measured by a wave exposure index ({REI}), tidal current speed and water depth, to various measures of the sedimentary environment, spatial heterogeneity of seagrass distribution and measures of seagrass abundance. Seagrass beds in this area form patterns ranging from continuous to semi-continuous to widely dispersed, discrete patches across a gradient of increasing hydrodynamic activity. Tidal current speeds, exposure to waves and relative water depths revealed strong correlative evidence that physical processes influenced landscape-scale (50 * 50 m range with 1 m resolution) features of seagrass beds. Some habitat attributes, such as percent cover of seagrasses, seagrass bed perimeter to area ratio, sediment organic content and percent silt-clay, declined with increasing {REI} and current speed. Increased aggregation of these data was observed above and below the 50\% seagrass cover value, and, supported by principle components analysis, signaled an abrupt transition of environmental setting correlated with this coverage level. The 50\% cover value also occurred at current speeds of {\textasciitilde}25 cm s-1, which should be near the initiation of motion current speed for local sand sediments, and an {REI} of {\textasciitilde}3 * 106. This coverage is also near to the 59.28\% coverage value, previously determined to be where landscape elements join and below which they tend to exist as discrete patches. We hypothesize that a rapid loss of seagrass habitat structural integrity may occur as the habitat fragments, and seagrass landscape elements become isolated, contributing to the observed transition and accompanying data aggregation above and below the {\textasciitilde}50\% coverage level. We discuss the interaction of physical setting, disturbance, landscape contiguity and growth response by these modular plants in the production of the observed landscape patterns across these hydrodynamic gradients.},

@article{deegan_coastal_2012,
	Abstract = {Salt marshes are highly productive coastal wetlands that provide important ecosystem services such as storm protection for coastal cities, nutrient removal and carbon sequestration. Despite protective measures, however, worldwide losses of these ecosystems have accelerated in recent decades. Here we present data from a nine-year whole-ecosystem nutrient-enrichment experiment. Our study demonstrates that nutrient enrichment, a global problem for coastal ecosystems, can be a driver of salt marsh loss. We show that nutrient levels commonly associated with coastal eutrophication increased above-ground leaf biomass, decreased the dense, below-ground biomass of bank-stabilizing roots, and increased microbial decomposition of organic matter. Alterations in these key ecosystem properties reduced geomorphic stability, resulting in creek-bank collapse with significant areas of creek-bank marsh converted to unvegetated mud. This pattern of marsh loss parallels observations for anthropogenically nutrient-enriched marshes worldwide, with creek-edge and bay-edge marsh evolving into mudflats and wider creeks. Our work suggests that current nutrient loading rates to many coastal ecosystems have overwhelmed the capacity of marshes to remove nitrogen without deleterious effects. Projected increases in nitrogen flux to the coast, related to increased fertilizer use required to feed an expanding human population, may rapidly result in a coastal landscape with less marsh, which would reduce the capacity of coastal regions to provide important ecological and economic services.},

	Abstract = {Multi-century sea-level records and climate models indicate an acceleration of sea-level rise, but no 20th century acceleration has previously been detected. A reconstruction of global sea level using tide-gauge data from 1950 to 2000 indicates a larger rate of rise after 1993 and other periods of rapid sea-level rise but no significant acceleration over this period. Here, we extend the reconstruction of global mean sea level back to 1870 and find a sea-level rise from January 1870 to December 2004 of 195 mm, a 20th century rate of sea-level rise of 1.7 $\pm$ 0.3 mm yr−1 and a significant acceleration of sea-level rise of 0.013 $\pm$ 0.006 mm yr−2. This acceleration is an important confirmation of climate change simulations which show an acceleration not previously observed. If this acceleration remained constant then the 1990 to 2100 rise would range from 280 to 340 mm, consistent with projections in the {IPCC} {TAR}.},

	Abstract = {Tidal rivers feature oscillatory and steady gradients in the water surface, controlled by interactions between river flow and tides. The river discharge attenuates the tidal motion, and tidal motion increases tidal-mean friction in the river, which may act as a barrier to the river discharge. Time series of tidal water level amplitudes at five gauge stations along the River Mahakam in Indonesia, and tidal flow velocity amplitudes at a discharge monitoring station were obtained applying wavelet analysis. Temporal variations in tidal damping coefficients for quaterdiurnal, semidiurnal, and diurnal tidal species were quantified from the observed amplitude profiles. The analysis shows that tidal damping during the rising limb of a discharge wave differs from damping during the falling limb. Wavelet cross-correlations between surface levels yielded empirical estimates of wave numbers. An empirical relation between tidal damping and river flow is derived to describe subtidal bottom friction along an idealized tidal river resembling the Mahakam. The subtidal friction is decomposed into contributions from the river flow only, from river-tide interaction, and from tidal asymmetry. Even for high river flow and low tidal velocity, river flow enhances friction attributed to river-tide interaction, causing subtidal water level setup. A simple multilinear regression model using subtidal bottom friction is employed to predict subtidal water levels at locations upstream, with a relatively good agreement between predictions and observations. The explicit expression shows the nonlinear dependence of subtidal friction on river flow velocity, explaining the complex behavior of tidal-mean surface level profiles.},

Infragravity oscillations of water level (∼ 27 min period) of 1--2 cm height correlate with a quarter wavelength resonance over the shelf. Particle displacements associated with these waves may be important to the dispersive characteristics of the reef environment. Estimates of cross-reef mass transport per unit width ranged from 0.058 to 0.032 m2s -1. Sea level differences across the reef (1--4 cm) varied at diurnal and infragravity periods with contributions from wave set-up, and a small contribution from cross-shelf wind stress to the observed sea level differences. The quadratic bottom friction coefficient over the reef was estimated at 0.06--0.2, 20--70 times greater than on open shelves, reflecting the reef's extreme bottom roughness.},

	Abstract = {Entrance closure has been identified by the local coastal communities as one of the more important management problems for the small barrier estuaries. The paper describes analyses of water level records and a simulation model illustrating tidal and fluvial interactions with the estuarine morphology. As management tools, they may be used to identify conditions likely to lead to restriction of tidal exchange through the estuary entrance. Ten months of water level data and two morphological surveys for Lake Conjola, a typical small barrier estuary south of Sydney, Australia, are examined here. The data analysis has included determination of the principal tidal constituents and mean water level, using a rolling time window. Different typical responses of the constituents have been found to storms accompanied by high stream inflow and those accompanied by sand overwash and to gradual accretion of sand in the entrance. Fluvial, tidal and morphological data for periods following a major fluvial event, have been examined to provide data on the progression of entrance conditions from partly closed, through scoured and through partial closure by an overwash event. The relative contribution of fluvial fluxes, tidal flows and coastal storms has been evaluated. The model, which simulates the response of a simple basin to tidal forcing and fluvial inflow, provides outputs which include diagrams of tidal attenuation and entrance velocities as functions of entrance resistance and fluvial inflow. On these diagrams may be plotted trajectories showing the response to the different types of events.},

@article{delpey_effects_2014,
	Abstract = {A three-dimensional wave-current model is used to investigate wave-induced circulations in a small estuarine bay and its impact on freshwater exchanges with the inner shelf, related to stratified river plume dispersion. Modeled salinity fields exhibit a lower salinity surface layer due to river outflows, with typical depth of 1 m inside the bay. The asymmetric wave forcing on the bay circulation, related to the local bathymetry, significantly impacts the river plumes. It is found that the transport initiated in the surf zone by the longshore current can oppose and thus reduce the primary outflow of freshwater through the bay inlets. Using the model to examine a high river runoff event occurring during a high-energy wave episode, waves are found to induce a 24 h delay in freshwater evacuation. At the end of the runoff event, waves have reduced the freshwater flux to the ocean by a factor 5, and the total freshwater volume inside the bay is increased by 40\%. According to the model, and for this event, the effect of the surf zone current on the bay flushing is larger than that of the wind. The freshwater balance is sensitive to incident wave conditions. Maximum freshwater retention is found for intermediate offshore wave heights 1 m {\textless} Hs {\textless} 2 m. For higher-energy waves, the increase in the longshore current reduces the retention, which is two times lower for Hs = 4 m than for Hs = 2 m.},

The morphodynamics concerns feedbacks between three major components: the hydrodynamics of tidal currents and wind waves; the erosion, deposition, and transport of sediment under the action of the former hydrodynamic agencies; and the morphology proper, which results from the divergence of the sediment transport. We discuss the morphodynamics of the different units that characterize a tidal inlet system: the overall system, the ebb-tidal delta, the tidal channels, channel networks, tidal bars and meanders, and finally the intertidal zone of tidal flats and salt marshes. In most of these units, stability analysis is a major guide to the establishment of equilibrium structures.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The geometric complexity of coral reefs leads to interesting fluid mechanics problems at scales ranging from those of coral colonies or even branches a few millimeters in diameter up to whole reefs that can be kilometers in horizontal extent. In many cases, both at the colony and reef scale, unsteady flows, usually due to surface waves, behave very differently than do steady flows for which the coral structures may appear to have quite high resistance to any flow through their interior. Allowing for this difference, engineering formulae for mass transfer describe well the uptake of nutrients by corals, although a priori determination of hydrodynamic roughness of corals and coral reefs is not yet possible. Surface wave-driven flows are a common feature of many coral reefs and appear to follow predictions of theories based on radiation stress gradients. However, comparisons to observations have been relatively limited, and there is some question as to the role played by Stokes drift in these flows. Like other near-shore environments, internal waves and flows driven by horizontal buoyancy gradients can also be important.},

	Abstract = {The Pirapama system in Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil, is one of the last   major sources of adequate water supply in the state. A reservoir was   constructed to store water for domestic, agricultural and industrial   use. However, the formation of the reservoir pool flooded the marginal   vegetation, starting an organic matter mineralization process, which   resulted in eutrophication of the waters and depletion of dissolved   oxygen concentrations, reaching anoxic conditions near the reservoir   bed. This water body is also impacted by upstream inputs of domestic   sewage, agricultural run-off and effluents from sugar-cane mills and   distilleries. This work applied a one-dimensional vertical approach   ({CE}-{QUAL}-R1) in order to simulate the formation of the reservoir pool,   analysing the different operational alternatives. Eutrophication, anoxia   and stratification potentials were studied. Water quality data obtained   during 17 months are used to adjust the model rates and parameters.   After model calibration-validation, hypothetical operational scenarios   were simulated, taking into account different ways for water pumping   (outtake elevations) and for discharging outflow excess (spillways or   bottom outlet). Strong anoxic conditions ({DO} concentrations of less than   1.0 mg.L-1), associated to high eutrophication levels (high {PO}4 and   Chlorophyll-a concentrations), were found in all simulated scenarios.   Regarding water quality conditions in the reservoir, the use of bottom   outlet for reservoir water releases presented better results than the   other operational alternatives, since it makes possible releasing anoxic   waters from the deepest layers of the reservoir pool. However, in these   conditions, the water quality downstream from the reservoir was severely   compromised.},

	Abstract = {Wave set-up may be significant in determining water levels on coral reefs particularly in microtidal environments and hence is an important factor for the design of reef-top structures and for the stability of reef-top islands. Laboratory experiments have been made on a two dimensional model of an idealised horizontal reef under two different conditions corresponding to a fringing reef (or closed lagoon) situation and a platform reef (or open lagoon) situation. Both wave set-up on the reef-top and the wave-generated flow across the reef were measured and related to wave and tide level conditions.

All other factors being the same, wave set-up is greatest at low tide levels whereas wave-generated flow is greater at higher tide levels. The magnitude of the set-up on a platform reef with a wave-generated flow is less than on a fringing reef without any net flow by an amount equal to the velocity head of the flow across the reef. Dimensionless parameters {\textbackslash}̄{ghrT}√ ηo and q√{gHo}3 are found to be functions of relative submergence parameters {hrHo} or (ηr + hr)Ho. For values of ({\textbackslash}̄ghr + hr) Ho \&gt; 1 waves break on the reef-top and radiation stress theory can be used to calculate set-up. For ({\textbackslash}̄ghr + hr)Ho \&lt; 0.7 waves break on the reef-face and set-up is determined by broadcrested weir control at the reef-edge.

@article{janzen_low-frequency_1998,
	Abstract = {The low-frequency transport processes in a small, shallow coastal lagoon (Indian River Bay, Delaware) are examined based on a set of data derived from tide gauges, near-bottom current meter measurements, and drifter releases. The subtidal sea-level fluctuations in the interior of the lagoon are forced primarily by the coastal sea-level fluctuations off the mouth of the inlet, which connects the lagoon with the coastal ocean. The effect of local wind plays a secondary role in modifying the coastally forced sea level inside the lagoon. Given the continuity constraint which links sea-level fluctuations to the depth and laterally integrated barotropic transport, the coastal pumping effect would be expected to be the dominant factor in controlling the subtidal barotropic exchange within the bay. However, the dominance of the coastal pumping effect on the barotropic exchange does not readily translate into the dominance of this effect on the transport and distribution of waterborne material in the bay at subtidal frequencies. The observed nearbottom subtidal current fluctuations are not coherent with the coastal sea-level fluctuations. The observed current is also much stronger than the barotropic current inferred from the continuity constraint. This suggests the presence of a depth-dependent flow field, with current in the upper layer fluctuating in opposite direction to that at depth. Furthermore, the observed near-bottom current also shows significant spatial variability within the bay. As for the mean current, the residual flow field shows distinctly different patterns between the surface and the bottom. The residual current at the surface exhibits a consistent mean flow out of the bay. At the bottom, the residual current shows a mean flow into the estuary in the upper part of the lagoon and a spatially variable flow in the lower part of the lagoon. A competition between gravitational circulation and tidally rectified current may contribute to the observed vertical and horizontal variabilities in the residual flow field.},

@article{niedda_tidal_2007,
	Abstract = {Environmental monitoring and hydrodynamic studies were carried out to understand the forcing mechanisms that are responsible for the circulation patterns of the several small coastal lagoons of Sardinia, in the center of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy. The water level observed in the Calich lagoon showed a free-surface oscillation with a semidiurnal period (tide) and a second order oscillation with higher frequency and lower amplitude (seiche). The wind has a local effect on these oscillations and generates a secondary circulation. Numerical analysis confirmed that the dynamics of the lagoon is mainly controlled by a balance between accelerations, barotropic pressure gradients, and bed and wind stresses, and highlighted that the surface seiche is one of the mechanisms responsible for driving residual currents. The employed 2D-horizontal model of lagoon hydrodynamics, forced with tides only at the basin boundary, reproduced the natural mode oscillation period of 0.5\&\#xa0;h of the basin. Besides, our study evaluated the accuracy of the simulation of the seiche and wind effects. The plane 2D model, forced with the measured wind stress above the basin surface, simulated stronger seiches by strength and variability in the wind field, in agreement with the measured seiche and wind data. The 5-min time step of our monitoring was, however, too large to quantify accurately the relationship between seiche-induced residual circulation and wind stress. Simulation results indicate that the wind variations at the time scale of minutes could affect the strength of the seiche oscillation. Nevertheless, this variability had insignificant effect on the frequency, suggesting that the oscillatory response is predominantly linear. This analysis showed that tidal, atmospheric and seiche forcing mechanisms are responsible for the circulation patterns of these small Mediterranean wetland areas, generating water level oscillations each one with specific frequency, but with amplitudes of the same order.},

@article{delpey_effects_2013,
	Abstract = {A three-dimensional wave-current model is used to investigate wave-induced circulations in a small estuarine bay and its impact on freshwater exchanges with the inner shelf, related to stratified river plumes dispersion. Modeled salinity fields exhibit a lower salinity surface layer due to river outflow, with typical depth of 1 m inside the bay. The asymetric wave forcing on the bay circulation, related to the local bathymetry, significantly impacts the river plumes. It is found that the transport initiated in the surf zone by the longshore current can oppose and thus reduce the primary outflow of freshwater through the bay inlets. Using the model to examine a high river runoff event occurring during a high-energy wave episode, waves are found to induce a 24 h delay in freshwater evacuation. At the end of the runoff event, waves have reduced the freshwater flux to the ocean by a factor 5, and the total freshwater volume inside the bay is increased by 40\%. According to the model, and for this event, the effect of the surf zone current on the bay flushing is larger than that of the wind. The freshwater balance is sensitive to incident wave conditions, with a maximum freshwater retention found for intermediate offshore wave heights 1 m {\textless}Hs {\textless} 2 m. The longshore current increase for higher-energy waves reduces the retention, which is 2 times lower for Hs = 4 m than for Hs = 2 m.},

@article{maccready_model_2009-1,
	Abstract = {A numerical simulation of circulation in the Columbia River estuary and   plume during the summer of 2004 is used to explore the mixing involved   as river water is transformed into shelf water. The model is forced with   realistic river flow, tides, wind stress, surface heat flux, and ocean   boundary conditions. Simulated currents and water properties on the   shelf near the mouth are compared with records from three moorings (all   in 72 m of water) and five {CTD} sections. The model is found to have   reasonable skill; statistically significant correlations between   observed and modeled surface currents, temperature, and salinity are all   0.42-0.72 for the mooring records. Equations for the tidally averaged,   volume-integrated mechanical energy budget (kinetic and potential) are   derived, with attention to the effects of. (i) Reynolds averaging, (ii)   a time varying volume due to the free surface, and (iii) dissipation   very close to the bottom. It is found that convergence of tidal pressure   work is the most important forcing term in the estuary. In the far field   plume (which has a volume 15 times greater than that of the estuary),   the net forcing is weaker than that in the estuary, and may be due to   either tidal currents or wind stress depending on the time period   considered. These forcings lead to irreversible mixing of the   stratification (buoyancy flux) that turns river water into shelf water.   This occurs in both the plume and estuary, but appears to be more   efficient (17\% vs. 5\%), and somewhat greater (4.2 {MW} vs. 3.3 {MW}), in   plume vs. estuary. This demonstrates the importance of both wind and   tidal forcing to watermass transformation, and the need to consider the   estuary and plume as part of a single system. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{baldock_overtopping_2012,
	Abstract = {The overtopping of solitary waves and bores present major hazards during the initial phase of tsunami inundation and storm surges. This paper presents new laboratory data on overtopping events by both solitary waves and solitary bores. Existing empirical overtopping scaling laws are found to be deficient for these wave forms. Two distinct scaling regimes are instead identified. For solitary waves, the overtopping rates scale linearly with the deficit in run-up freeboard. The volume flux in the incident solitary wave is also an important parameter, and a weak dependence on the nonlinearity of the waves (H/d) is observed. For solitary bores, the overtopping cannot be scaled uniquely, because the fluid momentum behind the incident bore front is independent of the bore height, but it is in close agreement with recent solutions of the nonlinear shallow water equations. The maximum overtopping rate for the solitary waves is shown to be the lower bound of the overtopping rate for the solitary bores with the same deficit in freeboard. Thus, for a given run-up, the solitary bores induce greater overtopping rates than the solitary waves when the relative freeboard is small.},

@article{straneo_rapid_2010,
	Abstract = {The recent rapid increase in mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet is primarily attributed to an acceleration of outlet glaciers. One possible cause of this acceleration is increased melting at the ice--ocean interface, driven by the synchronous warming of subtropical waters offshore of Greenland. However, because of the lack of observations from Greenland's glacial fjords and our limited understanding of their dynamics, this hypothesis is largely untested. Here we present oceanographic data collected in Sermilik Fjord, East Greenland, by ship in summer 2008 and from moorings. Our data reveal the presence of subtropical waters throughout the fjord. These waters are continuously replenished through a wind-driven exchange with the shelf, where they are present all year. The temperature and renewal of these waters indicate that they currently cause enhanced submarine melting at the glacier terminus. Key controls on the melting rate are the volume and properties of the subtropical waters on the shelf, and the patterns of along-shore winds, suggesting that the glaciers' acceleration has been triggered by a combination of atmospheric and oceanic changes. Our measurements provide evidence for a rapid advective pathway for the transmission of oceanic variability to the ice-sheet margins.},

@article{ledwell_tracer_1995,
	Abstract = {A tracer release experiment to study diapycnal and isopycnal mixing was performed in Santa Cruz Basin in 1988--1989. Approximately 1450 g of sulfur hexafluoride were injected close to an isopycnal surface at 1500 m depth in May 1988. This depth is midway between the bottom of the basin at 1920 m and the sill at 1084 m. The diapycnal dispersion measured during the first few months, while the tracer was still mixing to the walls of the basin, yielded a diapycnal eddy diffusivity of 1.0 cm2 s−1, within a factor of 1.5. This is approximately 4 times larger than the diffusivity found by Ledwell and Watson (1991) in the interior of Santa Monica Basin, where the buoyancy frequency was 5 times greater. The tracer was well mixed to the walls 6 months after the injection, and at that time the diapycnal spread of the tracer was greater near the walls than in the interior. The rate of diapycnal dispersion of the tracer increased dramatically after the tracer had mixed to the walls of the basin, indicating enhanced boundary mixing. An effective basin-wide diapycnal diffusivity of 10 cm2 s−1 would be required to support the fluxes of tracer observed. A one-dimensional model for tracer and heat diffusion does not simulate the results very well, however, probably because of the finite mixing time between the boundary region and interior and because of the complexity of the processes in the boundary region.},

	Abstract = {The ability of turbulence models, based on two equation closure schemes (the k-ε and the k-ω formulations) to compute the mean flow and turbulence structure in open channels with rigid, nonemergent vegetation is analyzed. The procedure, developed by Raupach and Shaw (1982), for atmospheric flows over plant canopies is used to transform the 3D problem into a more tractable 1D framework by averaging the conservation laws over space and time. With this methodology, form/drag related terms arise as a consequence of the averaging procedure, and do not need to be introduced artificially in the governing equations. This approach resolves the apparent ambiguity in previously reported values of the drag-related weighting coefficients in the equations for the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rates. The working hypothesis for the numerical models is that the flux gradient approximation applies to spatial/temporal averaged conservation laws, so that the eddy viscosity concept can be used. Numerical results are compared against experimental observations, including mean velocities, turbulence intensities, Reynolds stresses, and different terms in the turbulent kinetic energy budget. The models are used to further estimate vegetation-induced flow resistance. In agreement with field observations, Manning's coefficient is almost uniform for some critical plant density and then increases linearly.},

	Abstract = {Estuarine convergence (landward reduction of width and/or depth) is known to have the potential to significantly enhance estuarine circulation, a result theoretically derived under the assumption of constant eddy viscosity. Recent studies of longitudinally uniform energetic tidal channels indicate that tidal straining, a process driven by tidally varying eddy viscosity, is a major driver of estuarine circulation. The combined effect of estuarine convergence and tidal straining is investigated, for the first time, in this paper. The present idealized numerical study shows that estuarine convergence is reducing or even reversing tidal straining circulation in such a way that estuarine circulation can be weakened. This is a counterintuitive hydrodynamic effect of estuarine convergence, which may reduce (rather than increase) up-estuary particulate matter transport in estuaries and tidal inlets.},

	Abstract = {Spring floods carry Alaskan river water north to a frozen Beaufort Sea. A plume of water from the Sagavanirktok River ({SR}) was identified and traced by measuring salinity, δ18O, and dissolved silica in discrete water samples collected beneath landfast ice in the coastal Alaskan Beaufort Sea from late May to early June 2004 during high river flow. An Optimum Multiparameter analysis was used to calculate the fractions of {SR} water from the measured geochemical parameters. The {SR} plume followed the northwestward flowing local circulation and moved ∼17 km north and ∼15 km west under ice from the river mouth. The river plume was ∼1--1.5 m thick beneath the ice and flowed above a persistent halocline in the top 2.5 m of the water column. The calculated volume of {SR} water beneath the ice on 2 June was ∼0.5 km3, approximately 50\% of the river discharge during the study period. The volume of water that was not accounted for was assumed to flow above the ice canopy or was not captured during the study. Interactions of {SR} water with another under-ice plume from the Kuparuk River resulted in increased northward transport of both freshwater discharges.},

@article{bowen_edge_1978,
	Abstract = {Surf beat, wave motion at relatively low frequency (periods of 30--200 s), is often observed on beaches. However, even with modern instrumentation it is difficult to describe the spatial variation of the low-frequency motion; consequently, the relative importance of a number of suggestions which, at least in theory, provide mechanisms for the generation of low-frequency energy has never been established. Recent observations (e.g., Huntley, 1976) have reinforced the idea that edge waves, the free wave modes trapped at the shoreline, are a major component of low-frequency energy. One of the most interesting explanations of surf beat suggests that the beating between particular pairs of incoming waves leads to resonant growth of edge wave modes, which may then dominate the low-frequency spectrum (Gallagher, 1971). Empirical evidence is essential, as any theoretical development breaks down when the incoming waves break, a fundamental problem with Gallagher's (1971) model. To investigate the importance of this resonant interaction, the general interaction conditions were therefore used to design laboratory experiments in which both resonant and nonresonant conditions were expected. The experimental results show that the response at the beat frequency is stronger when the resonance conditions for edge wave growth are satisfied and that the response is in the form of the theoretically predicted edge wave mode, even when the incident waves are breaking. These results strongly suggest that surf beat is predominantly an edge wave phenomenon.},

@article{van_heerden_barrier/estuarine_1985,
	Abstract = {{SUMMARY} Bot River estuary can be classified as an end-member stage of a bar-built estuary, occupying a drowned river valley. The modern barrier consists of fairly large back-barrier dunes, hummocky foredunes and a dissipative beach. Aerial photographs were interpreted to assess whether the estuary has during modern times always had its present configuration, and to interpret the present physical processes based upon changing morphological features. Lowering of sea-level following the Late Holocene high-water stand exposed a sandy strand plain between Kleinmond and Hawston. Wind action forced an eastward transport of these sands creating a large dune field between Sonesta and Hawston, and a deflation surface at Rooisand. In 1938 the Lamloch swamps were well vegetated but by 1981 large formerly vegetated areas had been converted to open water as a result of subsidence. Long periods of mouth closure forced high water-levels in the estuary which flooded the deflated Rooisand area. Eventually estuarine waters made their way into the subsiding Lamloch swamp via two distinct pathways. Creation of the two channels reflects the natural adjustment of the water bodies to closure of the estuary mouth. Conceivably, barring man's intervention, the system could revert back to an estuary experiencing more regular marine interchange. That is, the estuary would consist of a brackish coastal lake connected by a sinuous estuary (Lamloch and Rooisand areas) to the sea at Kleinmond. The modern barrier is prograding landward into the estuary due to sediment introduced during washovers. Barrier accretion is enhanced when the barrier fronting the estuary is artificially breached.},

@article{pomeroy_dynamics_2012,
	Abstract = {A 3 week field study was conducted to investigate the dynamics of low-frequency (infragravity) wave motions over a fringing reef at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. Short-period wave motions (0.04--0.2 Hz) were observed to dissipate on the reef crest beyond which infragravity wave motions (0.004--0.04 Hz) gradually dominated toward the lagoon. However, both the short waves and the infragravity waves were relatively small (both {\textless}0.3 m) on the reef flat owing to the shallow water depth ({\textless}2 m). The results revealed that the surf zone generation of free infragravity wave motions on the steep (∼1:20) fore-reef slope was dominated by breakpoint forcing (as opposed to shoaling bound waves), which was also supported by detailed numerical simulations of the generation process. This is consistent with theory suggesting the efficiency of the breakpoint forcing mechanism should be high in this steep-slope regime. Shoreward propagating infragravity waves traveled across the reef but were damped by bottom friction dissipation; however, this was at a rate much smaller than experienced by the residual short waves. With these rates of frictional dissipation also strongly dependent on the water depth over the reef, the infragravity wave heights increased at higher water levels and hence were strongly modulated by the tide. Due to the strong dissipation of infragravity waves over this wide and shallow reef that is hydraulically rough, any seaward propagating infragravity waves that reflected at the shoreline were small, leading to the dominance of progressive (shoreward propagating) infragravity wave motions throughout the reef and lagoon.},

@article{aubrey_study_1985,
	Abstract = {The offshore tide becomes strongly distorted as it propagates into shallow estuarine systems. Observations of sea surface elevation and horizontal currents over periods ranging from three days to one year, at nine stations within Nauset inlet/estuary, document the non-linear interaction of the off-shore equilibrium tidal constituents. Despite strong frictional attenuation within the estuary, the overtides and compound tides of M2, S2 and N2, in particular, reach significant amplitude, resulting in strong tidal distortion. High frequency forced constituents in sea surface are phase-locked, consistently leading the forcing tides by 60--70$\,^{\circ}$, resulting in a persistent distortion where falling tide is longer than rising tide. Forced constituents in currents are more nearly in phase with equilibrium constituents, producing flood currents which are shorter but more intense than ebb currents. A compound fortnightly tide, {MSf}, modulates the mean water level such that lowest tides occur during neap phase instead of spring phase. This fortnightly tide can be contaminated by storm surge, changing the phase characteristics of this constituent. Implications of the overtides, compound tides, and lower frequency tides on near-bed, suspended and dissolved material transport are profound.},

@article{talke_feedback_2009,
	Abstract = {Motivated by field studies of the Ems estuary which show longitudinal gradients in bottom sediment concentration as high as O(0.01 kg/m4), we develop an analytical model for estuarine residual circulation based on currents from salinity gradients, turbidity gradients, and freshwater discharge. Salinity is assumed to be vertically well mixed, while the vertical concentration profile is assumed to result from a balance between a constant settling velocity and turbulent diffusive flux. Width and depth of the model estuary are held constant. Model results show that turbidity gradients enhance tidally averaged circulation upstream of the estuarine turbidity maximum ({ETM}), but significantly reduce residual circulation downstream, where salinity and turbidity gradients oppose each other. We apply the condition of morphodynamic equilibrium (vanishing sediment transport) and develop an analytical solution for the position of the turbidity maximum and the distribution of suspended sediment concentration ({SSC}) along a longitudinal axis. A sensitivity study shows great variability in the longitudinal distribution of suspended sediment with the applied salinity gradient and six model parameters: settling velocity, vertical mixing, horizontal dispersion, total sediment supply, fresh water flow, and water depth. Increasing depth and settling velocity move the {ETM} upstream, while increasing freshwater discharge and vertical mixing move the {ETM} downstream. Moreover, the longitudinal distribution of {SSC} is inherently asymmetric around the {ETM}, and depends on spatial variations in the residual current structure and the vertical profile of {SSC}.},

@article{hearn_wave-breaking_1999,
	Abstract = {This paper considers the hydrodynamics of wave-driven flow across a coral reef and the resultant flushing of its lagoon. Current depth coefficients are introduced that describe the fractional change of across-reef and lagoonal current with change in the relative local sea level, i.e., the depth of water over the reef flat. The coefficients are derived from an analytical hydrodynamic model and compared with data from two reefs. The first is Ningaloo Reef in northwest Australia, which is a typical barrier reef with a narrow coastal lagoon, and the second is Kaneohe Bay in Oahu, Hawaii, where the reef is both unusually deep and wide. The current depth coefficients are shown to be sensitive to the form of the frictional law on the reef flat and can be deduced from measurements of the astronomical tidal currents in the lagoon. Both quadratic and linear friction laws are considered for the reef flat and good agreement obtained with a linear law based on the high-frequency motion due to surface gravity waves.},

@article{simpson_reynolds_2004,
	Abstract = {We report new measurements of the turbulent properties of the flow in a tidally energetic estuarine channel of almost uniform cross-section. A high-frequency (1.2 {MHz}), bottom-mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler ({ADCP}) has been used to observe the velocity field at a sampling rate of 10 Hz in parallel with measurements of the surface elevation by tide gauges. Our data have been analysed using the Variance Method to determine turbulent kinetic energy ({TKE}), shear stress and {TKE} production over the tidal cycle with a time resolution of 60 s. During the highly energetic but brief flood period, when the surface axial velocity reaches ∼2 m s−1, we observed large values of stress (\&gt;2 Pa) and shear production (∼5 W m−3). {TKE} is also input through the release of energy in the bore itself which results in a brief but intense injection of energy at the bore front with large transient {TKE} levels (∼100 J m−3). Subsequent input by shear production maintains {TKE} levels which are generally lower (∼20 J m−3) than the strong peak associated with the bore for the rest of the flood. On the ebb, the flow is relatively tranquil with maximum speeds ∼0.5 m s−1 and peak {TKE} production rates of ∼0.1 W m−3. The flow and elevation data have also been used to estimate the energy fluxes into and out of the estuary. Short (∼1 h), intense energy inputs (∼8 {MW} at springs) on the flood flow are largely balanced by longer, less intense seaward energy flow on the ebb. The net energy input is found to be ∼0.1 {MW} at springs which is consistent with estimates of upstream dissipation. Peak dissipation in the bore itself may exceed the mean energy input but it is active only for a small fraction of the tidal cycle and its average contribution does not exceed ∼12\% of total dissipation.},

Through the reproduction of experimental flume tests and grid dependency tests, this method has shown its numerical coherence as well as its ability to simulate accurately both momentum and turbulent turbine-induced perturbations in both near and far wakes in a relatively short period of computation time.

	Abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of estuarine circulation and salinity structure are reviewed. We focus on well- and partially mixed systems that are long relative to the tidal excursion. Dynamics of the coupled system of width- and tidally averaged momentum and salt equations are now better understood owing to the development of simple numerical solution techniques. These have led to a greater appreciation of the key role played by the time dependency of the length of the salt intrusion. Improved realism in simplified tidally averaged physics has been driven by simultaneous advances in our understanding of the detailed dynamics within the tidal cycle and across irregular channel cross-sections. The complex interactions of turbulence, stratification, and advection are now understood well enough to motivate a new generation of physically plausible mixing parameterizations for the tidally averaged equations.},

@article{burchard_drivers_2011,
	Abstract = {The generation of residual circulation in a tidally energetic estuary with constant longitudinal salinity gradient and parabolic cross section is examined by means of a two-dimensional cross-sectional numerical model, neglecting river runoff and Stokes drift. It is shown how the longitudinal and lateral residual circulation can be decomposed into contributions from various processes such as tidal straining circulation, gravitational circulation, advectively driven circulation, and horizontal mixing circulation. The sensitivity of the residual circulation and its components from various processes to changes in forcing is investigated by varying the Simpson number (nondimensional longitudinal buoyancy gradient) and the unsteadiness parameter (nondimensional tidal frequency), as well as the bed roughness and the width of the estuary. For relatively weak salinity gradient forcing, the tidal straining circulation dominates the residual exchange circulation in support of classical estuarine circulation (up-estuary flow near the bed and down-estuary flow near the surface). The strength of the longitudinal estuarine circulation clearly increases with increased salinity gradient forcing. However, when the Simpson number exceeds 0.15, the relative contributions of both gravitational circulation and advectively driven circulation to estuarine circulation increase substantially. Lateral residual circulation is relatively weak for small Simpson numbers and becomes flood oriented (divergent flow near the bed and convergent flow near the surface) for larger Simpson numbers because of increasing contributions from gravitational and advectively driven circulation. Increasing the unsteadiness number leads to decreased longitudinal and lateral residual circulation. Although changes in bed roughness result in relatively small changes in residual circulation, results are sensitive to the width of the estuary, mainly because of changes in residual exchange circulation driven by tidal straining.},

@article{hearn_application_1998,
	Abstract = {During summer, the basins of shallow estuaries in mediterranean climates are usually vertically mixed, hypersaline, and sometimes inverse (in the sense of their densities being elevated above ocean values). These estuaries are commonly controlled by heat and salt exchange with the ocean. Because of the compensating effect of estuarine heating, the magnitude of the density inversion (due to hypersalinity) depends on the net surface buoyancy flux. The surface heat and evaporative fluxes are functions of the estuarine temperature and so the estuarine state (and its associated surface buoyancy flux) depends on the strength of the ocean exchange processes. A simple Stommel model of a summer mediterranean estuary is presented here in which this exchange is controlled by density-driven processes. The Stommel model has two possible stable stationary states and it is shown that the estuary can be characterized by four types of steady state. They include the familiar classical and inverse estuaries plus a solution, called ``quasi-neutral'', in which the estuary is close to neutrality but just marginally inverse; that is, the net buoyancy flux is small and negative. This quasi-neutral solution resembles the steady state in Tomales Bay (California) in late summer and shows the characteristic high level of thermal compensation of the density inversion from hypersalinity. It also has the observed very long flushing time which is responsible for some of the environmental fragility of this class of estuary. This appears to be the first detailed confirmation of the applicability of the Stommel model to estuaries. The fourth type of estuarine state arises from the simultaneous existence of both stable states. It is here called ``intermittent'' and contains both the classical and a quasi-neutral Stommel solution. The type of estuarine state achieved by a narrow basin in autumn is highly dependent on its length and depth. This produces extreme sensitivity to changes in basin geometry from human influences.},

@article{nnafie_effects_2014,
	Abstract = {Shoreface-connected sand ridges occur on many storm-dominated inner shelves. These rhythmic features have an along-shelf spacing of 2--10 km, a height of 1--12 m, they evolve on timescales of centuries and they migrate several meters per year. An idealized model is used to study the impact of sea level rise on the characteristics of the sand ridges during their initial and long-term evolution. Different scenarios (rates of sea level rise, geometry of inner shelf) are examined. Results show that with increasing sea level the height of sand ridges increases and their migration decreases until they eventually drown. This latter occurs when the near-bed wave orbital velocity drops below the critical velocity for erosion of sediment. In contrast, in the absence of sea level rise, the model simulates shoreface-connected sand ridges with constant heights and migration rates. Model results furthermore indicate that sand ridges do not form if the rate of sea level rise is too high, or if the initial depth of the inner shelf is too small. A larger transverse bottom slope enhances growth and height of sand ridges and they drown quicker. When shoreface retreat due to sea level rise is considered, new ridges form in the landward part of the inner shelf, while ridges on the antecedent part of the shelf become less active and ultimately drown. Only if sea level rise is accounted for, merging of ridges is reduced such that multiple ridges occur in the end state, thereby yielding a better agreement with observations. The physical mechanisms responsible for these findings are also explained.},

Then it summarizes the results of a series of studies, which show that parents distort their perceptions of their own children in gender role stereotypic activities such as math and sports, that the child's gender affects parents' causal attributions for their children's performance in gender role stereotypic activities, and that these perceptual biases influence the children's own self-perceptions and activity choices.

The dataset that is discussed quantifies turbulent mixing for a water column in northern San Francisco Bay that experiences a sequence of states that includes a weak ebb and flood that are stratified, followed by a strong, and eventually unstratified, ebb and flood. These measurements show that energetic turbulence is confined to a bottom mixed layer by the overlying stratification. Examination of individual Reynolds stress profiles along with profiles of Richardson number and turbulent Froude number shows that the water column can be divided into regions based on the relative importance of buoyancy effects. Using the measured turbulence production rate P, the dissipation rate ϵ is estimated.

@article{clarke_meso-scale_2014,
	Abstract = {Establishing the future trajectories of coastal wetlands, especially the nature of their disturbance, response and recovery regimes, is of critical importance for a wide range of stakeholders and environmental managers. Reconstructing meso-scale behaviour in coastal environments can serve to attune coastal resource management strategies to natural scales of system operations, thus fostering genuine sustainability. Sediments from Pescadero Marsh, a back-barrier coastal wetland in California, were analysed down-core for their particle size distribution in consecutive 2-mm sections. The particle size data reflect changing hydrodynamics in the back-barrier area driven by past variations in barrier coherence. When considered together, the down-core mean particle size trend and particle size distribution curve styles provide considerable insight into meso-scale system behaviour, revealing barrier/back-barrier disturbance--response--recovery regimes, regime shifts and the role of aperiodic high-energy events in disturbing these regimes. Over sub-annual and multi-annual time periods, the behaviour of the Pescadero system was consistently characterised by both dynamic response to disturbance and recovery through negative feedback. Furthermore, over the duration of the analysed core section, that is, 1200--2300 years, the system was determined to have adopted a series of static equilibrium states. The barrier estuary behaviour reconstructed from the Pescadero sediment record is indicative of innate environmental resilience.},

	Abstract = {Historical and instrumental data show that the Pacific coast of Mexico has been exposed to destructive tsunamis over at least the past 500 years. This coast is also affected by hurricanes generated in the eastern Pacific. The great 1985 Mexico earthquake and its aftershock generated tsunamis that affected the Ixtapa--Zihuatanejo and Michoac{\'a}n coast. The purpose of our study was two-fold --- a) to determine whether storm and tsunami deposits could be distinguished, and b) whether tsunami deposits from historical events are preserved in the tropical environments of the Ixtapa--Zihuatanejo coast. Two anomalous sand units in the Ixtapa estuary are interpreted to be the result of high-energy marine inundation events that occurred in the last century. Several lines of evidence using a multi-proxy approach (historical studies, interviews with local witnesses, geomorphological and geological surveys, coring and trenching, laboratory analyses including grain size, micropaleontology, geochemistry, magnetic susceptibility and radiometric dating, and numerical modeling) indicate the occurrence of two tsunamis that we link to local events: the 21st September 1985 Mexico and possibly the 14th March 1979 Petatlan earthquakes. We thereby provide the first onshore geological evidence of historical tsunamis on the Pacific coast of Mexico.},

	Abstract = {The introduction of students to methods of time-series analysis is a pedagogical challenge, since the availability of easily manipulated computer software presents an attractive alternative to an understanding of the computations, as well as their assumptions and limitations. A two-part pedagogical tutorial exercise is offered as a hands-on laboratory to complement classroom discussions or as a reference for students involved in independent research projects. The exercises are focused on the analysis of ocean waves, specifically wind-generated surfacegravity waves. The exercises are cross-disciplinary in nature and can be extended to any other field dealing with random signal analysis. The first exercise introduces the manual arithmetic steps of a finite Fourier analysis of a wave record, develops a spectrum, and compares these results to the results obtained using a fast Fourier transform ({FFT}). The second part of the exercise, described in the subsequent article, takes a longer wave record and addresses the theoretical and observed waveprobability distributions of wave heights and sea surface elevations. These results are then compared to a {FFT}, thus linking the two pedagogical laboratory exercise parts for a more complete understanding of both exercises.},

@article{wang_north_2004,
	Abstract = {Using the observed relationships between sea level pressure ({SLP}) and significant wave height ({SWH}) as represented by regression models, climate change scenarios of {SWH} in the North Atlantic were constructed by means of redundancy analysis (for seasonal means and 90th percentiles of {SWH}) and nonstationary generalized extreme value analysis (for seasonal extreme {SWH}). {SWH} scenarios are constructed using output from a coupled climate model under three different forcing scenarios. Scenarios of future anomaly seasonal statistics of {SWH} are constructed using climate model projections of anomaly seasonal mean {SLP} while projections of seasonal extreme {SWH} are made using projections of seasonal mean {SLP} and seasonal {SLP} gradient index. The projected changes in {SWH} are assessed by means of a trend analysis. The northeast Atlantic is projected to have increases in both winter and fall seasonal means and extremes of {SWH} in the twenty-first century under all three forcing scenarios. These changes are generally accompanied by decreases in the midlatitudes of the North Atlantic and increases in the southwest North Atlantic. The rate and sign of the projected {SWH} change is not constant throughout the twenty-first century. In the Norwegian and North Seas, the projected {SWH} changes are characterized either by faster increases in the late decades than in the early decades, or by decreases in the early decades followed by increases, depending on the forcing scenario and the specific location. Using lower or higher rates of increase in greenhouse gases forcing generally leads to reduced or increased rates of change, respectively, in ocean wave heights. The sign and rate of future wave height changes in the North Sea in particular appear to be quite dependent on the forcing conditions. In general, global warming is associated with more frequent occurrence of the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation ({NAO}) and strong cyclones, which leads to increases of wave heights in the northeast Atlantic.},

@article{browne_near-shore_2007,
	Abstract = {Estimation of swell conditions in coastal regions is important for a variety of public, government, and research applications. Driving a model of the near-shore wave transformation from an offshore global swell model such as {NOAA} {WaveWatch}3 is an economical means to arrive at swell size estimates at particular locations of interest. Recently, some work (e.g. Browne et al. [Browne, M., Strauss, D., Castelle, B., Blumenstein, M., Tomlinson, R., 2006. Local swell estimation and prediction from a global wind-wave model. {IEEE} Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters 3 (4), 462--466.]) has examined an artificial neural network ({ANN}) based, empirical approach to wave estimation. Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of two data driven approaches to estimating waves near-shore (linear and {ANN}), and also contrast these with a more traditional spectral wave simulation model ({SWAN}). Performance was assessed on data gathered from a total of 17 near-shore locations, with heterogenous geography and bathymetry, around the continent of Australia over a 7 month period. It was found that the {ANNs} out-performed {SWAN} and the non-linear architecture consistently out-performed the linear method. Variability in performance and differential performance with regard to geographical location could largely be explained in terms of the underlying complexity of the local wave transformation.},

@article{keshtpoor_numerical_????,
	Abstract = {{AbstractNearshore} hydrodynamics and sediment transport patterns induced by waves and tide adjacent to a structured tidal inlet with complex bathymetry are investigated to determine the potential causes of downdrift beach erosion. A coupled wave and hydrodynamic model is used to simulate the nearshore hydrodynamics and morphodynamics. Near the inlet, the tidal-induced pressure gradient dominates the wave radiation stress gradient only in the first half of the flood duration. The nearshore hydrodynamic pattern for the rest of the tidal cycle is driven mainly by the wave-driven pressure gradient. The wave-driven pressure gradient results from alongshore variation of water surface elevation induced by nearshore wave focal points caused by wave refraction over irregular bathymetry (with ebb tidal shoals and nonparallel shoreline depth contours). The resulting alongshore sediment transport patterns suggest that the direction of the time-averaged alongshore sediment transport rate near the inlet and at the downdrift beach is against that of the larger-scale net sediment transport along the coast. The inlet-adjacent time-averaged alongshore sediment transport rate increases for waves with larger wave height and an incident angle closer to shore normal in contrast to expectations under the assumption of straight and parallel depth contours.},

@article{malhadas_effect_2009,
	Abstract = {This study reports the role of waves, tide, wind and freshwater discharges over the sea level in {\'O}bidos Lagoon, a coastal system connected to the sea through a narrow and shallow mobile inlet. To address the hydrodynamic features of this coastal system, the relative importance of different physical forcings were evaluated. For this purpose, observations together with realistic and idealized numerical modeling were used. Both model and measurements show that the lagoon sea level remains above offshore sea level during storm wave periods. Hence, a simplified inlet-lagoon idealized model was described through mathematical expressions, to understand and highlight the physical processes responsible for sea-level elevation.

In general, it can be concluded that multiple forcing conditions, specifically tide and waves, are important in defining the dynamics of the {\'O}bidos Lagoon. The variability of the lagoon sea level is 80\% due to tide and 20\% due to waves. A correlation was found with wave height and sea-level elevation during high wave activity periods; no correlation was found for low wave activity. A significant super-elevation on lagoon sea level occurs during storm wave periods. Such super-elevation is explained, not only by wave set-up or radiation stresses due to waves, but also by tidal inlet morphology (mainly depth and length).},

@article{baldock_long_2006,
	Abstract = {This paper presents new laboratory data on the generation of long waves by the shoaling and breaking of transient-focused short-wave groups. Direct offshore radiation of long waves from the breakpoint is shown experimentally for the first time. High spatial resolution enables identification of the relationship between the spatial gradients of the short-wave envelope and the long-wave surface. This relationship is consistent with radiation stress theory even well inside the surf zone and appears as a result of the strong nonlinear forcing associated with the transient group. In shallow water, the change in depth across the group leads to asymmetry in the forcing which generates significant dynamic setup in front of the group during shoaling. Strong amplification of the incident dynamic setup occurs after short-wave breaking. The data show the radiation of a transient long wave dominated by a pulse of positive elevation, preceded and followed by weaker trailing waves with negative elevation. The instantaneous cross-shore structure of the long wave shows the mechanics of the reflection process and the formation of a transient node in the inner surf zone. The wave run-up and relative amplitude of the radiated and incident long waves suggests significant modification of the incident bound wave in the inner surf zone and the dominance of long waves generated by the breaking process. It is proposed that these conditions occur when the primary short waves and bound wave are not shallow water waves at the breakpoint. A simple criterion is given to determine these conditions, which generally occur for the important case of storm waves.},

	Abstract = {The rate of wave overtopping of a barrier beach is measured and modeled. Unique rate of wave overtopping field data are obtained from the measure of the Carmel River, California, lagoon filling during a time when the lagoon is closed-off with no river inflow. Volume changes are based on measured lagoon height changes applied to a measured hypsometric curve. Wave heights and periods are obtained from directional wave spectra data in 15 m fronting the beach. Beach morphology was measured by {GPS} walking surveys. Three empirical overtopping models by Van der Meer and Janssen (1995), Hedges and Reis (1998) and Pullen et al. (2007) with differing parameterizations on wave height, period and beach slope and calibrated using extensive laboratory data obtained over plane, impermeable beaches are applied in a quasi-2D manner and compared with the field observations. Three overtopping events are considered when morphology data were available less than 2 weeks prior to the event. The models are tuned to fit the data using a reduction factor to account for beach permeability, berm characteristics, non-normal wave incidence and surface roughness influence. In addition, the run-up model by Stockdon et al. (2006) based on field data is examined and found to underestimate run-up as the calculated values were too small to predict any of the observed overtopping. The three overtopping models performed similarly well with values of 0.72--0.87 for the two narrow-banded wave cases, with an average reduction factor of 0.78. The European model (Pullen et. al., 2007) performed best overall and in particular for the case of the broad-banded, double peaked wave spectrum.},

@article{gacia_approach_1999,
	Abstract = {Seagrass beds have traditionally been considered to act as sinks for particles due to the reduction of flow velocities by the plant canopy. Yet, there is a paucity of measurements to confirm this role. In this work we illustrate changes in flow in the presence and absence of Posidonia oceanica using an {ADV}, and provide direct measures of particle trapping by the use of sediment traps. We also describe a model to estimate sediment resuspension after measuring particle flux at different distances from the bottom. Measurements of particle flux are conducted parallel to the study of structural parameters of the Posidonia meadow potentially involved in both particle trapping and retention. Data obtained on velocity profiles confirm previous findings that seagrass canopies slow down current velocities with intensities proportional to the canopy height of the plants. The projected surface area of the plants ({LAI}) significantly correlated with the total amount of particles trapped within the Posidonia meadow, thus indicating seagrass canopy slightly increased particle trapping in the absence of resuspension. The trapping capacity of the canopy was not linearly correlated to {LAI} but significantly decreased at {LAI} above four, thus suggesting that other factors such as bending of the leaves and particle attachment to the surface may interfere with particle free sinking within the canopy at high projected surface area. The model proposed to estimate resuspension allowed to measure the retention capacity of the P. oceanica meadow, this being up to 15 times higher compared to a barren bottom during situations of high energy (large eddies reaching the bottom). The results obtained provide direct quantitative support to seagrass beds promoting sediment accretion and demonstrate a promising avenue to provide the needed empirical support for the effect of seagrasses on depositional processes.},

	Abstract = {The Palmiet Estuary (South Africa), a bar-built coastal plain estuary, was monitored during a dry-season spring/neap tide cycle. Information on water level, temperature, salinity and currents was collected. Estimates of dimensionless Reynolds and Richardson numbers indicate a three-layered structure. Apart from periodic localized turbulence near the mouth, inter-layer exchange occurred by extensive entrainment. Flushing times of the order of 12 hours, 2 days and 2 weeks were found for the surface, intermediate and bottom layers respectively. Extreme spring tides during the dry season (volume flow in excess of 20 m3·s−1 during flood) may allow the system to degenerate into a single saline layer partially covered by a very thin layer of freshwater. Extreme river flow during the wet season (volume flow in excess of 100 m3·s−1) may flush the estuary so that it only contains pure freshwater. It is suggested that five "fluvial-marine" states may be identified: very dry, dry, dry-wet, wet, very wet. The Palmiet functions as a highly stratified fjord-type system under average conditions but, owing to its limited capacity relative to the potential fluxes of water, the stratification pattern can change dramatically.},

	Abstract = {Abstract A biologically important feature of the Beaufort Sea is the occurrence of a band of relatively warm and brackish water (5--10 C, 10--25‰) that lies adjacent to the shoreline in summer. This estuarine band extends the length of the coast (750 km); it is very narrow (usually 2--10 km wide) and is often distinctly different from adjacent marine waters (-1 to 3 C, 27--32‰). The band provides important feeding habitat for anadromous and marine fishes. Dominant anadromous species are Arctic cisco Coregonus autumnalis, least cisco C. sardinella, and Arctic char Salvelinus alpinus which enter previously frozen nearshore waters each summer and feed extensively on an abundant supply of epibenthic mysids and amphipods. These fishes disperse parallel to the coastline, remaining in the estuarine band. Dominant marine species are Arctic cod Boreogadus saida and fourhorn sculpin Myoxocephalus quadricornis, which enter nearshore waters later in summer as salinities increase. In winter, the estuarine band is absent and most anadromous species return to North Slope drainages to spawn or overwinter; marine species remain under nearshore ice but eventually vacate shallow waters, which freeze solid to a depth of 2 m.

@article{short_offshore_1975,
	Abstract = {Well-developed offshore bars along the 1,355-km-long Alaskan Arctic coast possess three distinctive forms: (1) multiple parallel bars containing inner and outer bar systems; (2) long, parallel bars occurring in series but attached to the shore at their updrift ends; and (3) snorter en echelon bars attached to the shore. Some short en echelon bars are migrating to the west at a rate of \$70 m yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and moving sediment on the order of \$4 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{5\} m{\textasciicircum}\{3\} yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ . Bars attached to the beaches generate pronounced shoreline rhythms consisting of horns and bays with amplitudes up to 200 m and lengths of 4-5 km. Low beach-ridge and swale systems are preserved on the horns and destroyed in the bays. The bays, where the beach is narrowest, tend to coincide with locations of inlets or erosion of the tundra hinterland. Field evidence strongly indicates that variation in bar forms is related to the angle of dominant wave approach to the shore; bars tend to be shorter and more transverse to the shore where waves arrive at large angles, and longer and more parallel to the shore where waves arrive more parallel to the shore.},

@article{simpson_fronts_1978,
	Abstract = {A well-defined class of fronts occurring in the shelf seas around the United Kingdom during the summer months marks the boundary between stratified and vertically mixed regimes. The occurrence of these fronts may be interpreted in terms of the distribution of available turbulent kinetic energy from the tidal currents and wind stress and the buoyancy flux input at the surface. The principal parameter controlling stratification is the ratio of the water depth to a Monin-Obhukov length determined by the tidal velocity. A corresponding parameter based on the wind stress is also found to contribute significantly in a combined model of tide and wind mixing. Vertical sections perpendicular to the front by undulating {CTD} indicate a strongly baroclinic region with horizontal temperature gradients of ∼1$\,^{\circ}$C/km, which imply strong flows parallel to the front. Drogue observations show that nontidal velocities of ∼10 cm/s occur in the vicinity of the fronts but the flow regime is apparently complicated by large-scale (∼25 km) instabilities which are clearly manifest in satellite infrared imagery and airborne radiation thermometer surveys. There is also indirect evidence for vertical motions suggesting that both upwelling and down-welling occur in the frontal zone.},

@article{monsen_comment_2002,
	Abstract = {Applications of transport time scales are pervasive in biological, hydrologic, and geochemical studies yet these times scales are not consistently defined and applied with rigor in the literature. We compare three transport time scales (flushing time, age, and residence time) commonly used to measure the retention of water or scalar quantities transported with water. We identify the underlying assumptions associated with each time scale, describe procedures for computing these time scales in idealized cases, and identify pitfalls when real-world systems deviate from these idealizations. We then apply the time scale definitions to a shallow 378 ha tidal lake to illustrate how deviations between real water bodies and the idealized examples can result from: (1) non-steady flow; (2) spatial variability in bathymetry, circulation, and transport time scales; and (3) tides that introduce complexities not accounted for in the idealized cases. These examples illustrate that no single transport time scale is valid for all time periods, locations, and constituents, and no one time scale describes all transport processes. We encourage aquatic scientists to rigorously define the transport time scale when it is applied, identify the underlying assumptions in the application of that concept, and ask if those assumptions are valid in the application of that approach for computing transport time scales in real systems.},

@article{ralston_longitudinal_2005,
	Abstract = {Field observations indicate that a tidal salinity front that is regenerated each lower low water is a prominent feature of intertidal zone flow during wet winter months. A strong longitudinal density gradient at the front influences flow dynamics through tidal straining and baroclinic forcing. During each inundation period the salinity gradient disperses as it advects across the intertidal zone. The average longitudinal dispersivity estimated from observations is about 10 m2 s−1. A three-dimensional numerical model yields comparable estimates of tidally averaged dispersivity for an idealized bathymetry with a subtidal channel and intertidal shoals. The instantaneous dispersivity through the tidal cycle depends on both vertical and lateral shear in along-channel velocity. Dispersion due to vertical shear is greatest during stratified ebbs and inversely depends on tidal forcing; dispersion due to lateral shear results from bathymetric variability between channel and shoal and increases with tidal amplitude. Similarly, the along-channel residual velocity is a combination of baroclinic and frictional processes. Frictional effects dominate the depth-averaged residual such that net flow is upstream on the shoals and downstream in the channel; however, the frictional pattern is moderated by baroclinic forcing at the front. Although along-channel dynamics dominate, differential advection of the salinity front establishes lateral baroclinic circulation between channel and shoals. Lateral residual circulation is flood dominant with dense water moving out of channel near the bed and convergence from the shoals at the surface. At times near the front the lateral salt flux can significantly affect the salinity budget in the channel.},

@article{shchepetkin_regional_2005,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this study is to find a combination of optimal numerical algorithms for time-stepping and mode-splitting suitable for a high-resolution, free-surface, terrain-following coordinate oceanic model. Due to mathematical feedback between the baroclinic momentum and tracer equations and, similarly, between the barotropic momentum and continuity equations, it is advantageous to treat both modes so that, after a time step for the momentum equation, the computed velocities participate immediately in the computation of tracers and continuity, and vice versa, rather than advancing all equations for one time step simultaneously. This leads to a new family of time-stepping algorithms that combine forward--backward feedback with the best known synchronous algorithms, allowing an increased time step due to the enhanced internal stability without sacrificing its accuracy. Based on these algorithms we design a split-explicit hydrodynamic kernel for a realistic oceanic model, which addresses multiple numerical issues associated with mode splitting. This kernel utilizes consistent temporal averaging of the barotropic mode via a specially designed filter function to guarantee both exact conservation and constancy preservation properties for tracers and yields more accurate (up to second-order), resolved barotropic processes, while preventing aliasing of unresolved barotropic signals into the slow baroclinic motions. It has a more accurate mode-splitting due to redefined barotropic pressure-gradient terms to account for the local variations in density field, while maintaining the computational efficiency of a split model. It is naturally compatible with a variety of centered and upstream-biased high-order advection algorithms, and helps to mitigate computational cost of expensive physical parameterization of mixing processes and submodels.},

@article{speer_study_1985,
	Abstract = {The generation of tidal asymmetries is clarified via numerical integration of the one-dimensional equations for channel geometries characteristic of shallow estuaries. Channels without tidal flats develop a time asymmetry characterized by a longer falling than rising tide. This behavior is enhanced by strong friction and large channel cross-sectional area variability over a tidal cycle. Resulting tidal currents have a shorter, intense flood and a longer, weak ebb (flood-dominant). Addition of tidal flats to the channels can produce a longer rising tide and stronger ebb currents (ebb-dominant), if the area of tidal flats is large enough to overcome the effects of time-variable channel geometry. Weaker friction with flats can also produce this asymmetry.

Despite the physical complexity of these systems, essential features of estuarine tidal response can be recovered from one-dimensional models. Shallow estuaries are shown to have a system response leading to stable, uniform senses of tidal asymmetry (either flood- or ebb-dominated, due to phase-locking of forced tidal constituents), with down-channel development in magnitude of asymmetry. These concepts are illustrated by modeling idealized representations of tidal channels at Nauset Inlet, {MA}, and Wachapreague Inlet, {VA}, which have flood- and ebb-dominance, respectively.},

@article{simon_turbulence_2013,
	Abstract = {A sudden rise of the water depth in an open channel flow creates a surge propagating in the channel called a positive surge. Positive surges can be observed as natural phenomena when a spring tide enters a funnel-shaped estuary under appropriate tidal and bathymetric conditions: the process is called a tidal bore. In this study, the free surface profile and the unsteady turbulent motion of positive surges were studied physically in a relatively large facility under controlled conditions based upon a Froude similarity. The experiments were conducted in a 12 m long 0.5 m wide rectangular channel mostly covered by a rough fixed gravel bed. The metrology included a combination of acoustic Doppler velocimeters ({ADVs}) and acoustic displacement meters ({ADMs}). The initially steady flow conditions were controlled by the water discharge, and the steady flow properties were investigated thorougly using a Pitot tube and {ADV}. The positive surge was generated by the fast closure of a downstream gate and the bore propagated upstream against the initially steady flow. Both free-surface and velocity measurements were repeated a number of times to perform an ensemble average. The free surface characteristics were studied for both undular and breaking bores. The passage of the bore was associated with large free surface fluctuations, particularly in the case of breaking bores. The free surface properties were in agreement with earlier findings. The bore shape was closely linked with the Froude number and found to be independent of the distance travelled by the bore. High frequency (200 Hz) instantaneous velocity measurements were conducted 6.13 m upstream of the downstream gate. In the breaking bore, the data showed a transient longitudinal velocity reversal next to the bed beneath and immediately behind the bore front. In the undular bore, a deceleration of the streamwise velocity was observed without velocity reversal of the ensemble averaged velocity, but with transient negative values of the instantaneous longitudinal velocity. For both breaking and undular bores, the vertical velocity data trend followed closely the time derivative of the instantaneous water depth. Large velocity fluctuations were observed during the passage of the bore and in its wake. The turbulent integral length scales of the longitudinal and transverse velocity components were similar in magnitude in steady and unsteady flows, with slightly larger values in the unsteady flow on the upper measurements (z/do = 0.63). The turbulent integral time scales were larger in the unsteady flow. Further velocity measurements were performed immediately upstream of the gate and provided some insights into the time-variation of the velocity field during the bore generation. The turbulent stresses were larger beneath the bore close to the bed. After the bore front passage, the strongest fluctuations in terms of turbulent stresses were observed on the mid-water column and under the wave crests. Overall this study covered a broad range of unsteady flow conditions which were thoroughly investigated.},

@article{erbacher_increased_2001,
	Abstract = {Ocean anoxic events were periods of high carbon burial that led to drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide, lowering of bottom-water oxygen concentrations and, in many cases, significant biological extinction. Most ocean anoxic events are thought to be caused by high productivity and export of carbon from surface waters which is then preserved in organic-rich sediments, known as black shales. But the factors that triggered some of these events remain uncertain. Here we present stable isotope data from a mid-Cretaceous ocean anoxic event that occurred 112 Myr ago, and that point to increased thermohaline stratification as the probable cause. Ocean anoxic event 1b is associated with an increase in surface-water temperatures and runoff that led to decreased bottom-water formation and elevated carbon burial in the restricted basins of the western Tethys and North Atlantic. This event is in many ways similar to that which led to the more recent Plio-Pleistocene Mediterranean sapropels, but the greater geographical extent and longer duration (46 kyr) of ocean anoxic event 1b suggest that processes leading to such ocean anoxic events in the North Atlantic and western Tethys were able to act over a much larger region, and sequester far more carbon, than any of the Quaternary sapropels.},

@article{tonn_patterns_1982,
	Abstract = {Fish assemblage structure, and factors and mechanisms appearing important in the ecological maintence of these structures, were examined for 18 small lakes in northern Wisconsin during summer and winter. The study was focused around the following questions. Are there discrete, repeatable groups of fish assemblages? If so, are they temporally stable? What are the relations between fish assemblage structure and habitat complexity, physical disturbance, biotic interactions and the insular nature of small lakes? A comparative approach was used to generate hypotheses and propose explanations concerning the roles of these factors in structuring the assemblages. Multivariate classification, ordination, and discriminant analyses helped discern two assemblage types: Umbra-cyprinid and centrarchid-Esox. Each had a distinctive species composition and seasonal change in composition. Environmental characteristic of the lakes occupied by each assemblage type also differed consistently. The type of assemblage present in a lake appeared related to oxygen concentrations in winter, interacting with the availability of refuges from either a severe physical environment (low oxygen during winter) or from large pisvivores. Centrarchid-Esox assemblages occurred in lakes with high winter oxygen levels, and also in lakes with low oxygen if a stream or connecting lake could provide a refuge from these conditions in winter. When no refuge was present, low winter oxygen lakes lacked piscivorous fishes, but contained Umbra-cyprinid assemblages. The relationships between species richness in summer and environmental factors were generally similar for the two assemblage types, but the relative importance of individual factors differed. In winter, richness relationships in centrarchid-Esox assemblages for most environmental factors were reversed from those of summer. No significant seasonal change occurred in the Umbra-cyprinid assemblages. Habitat complexity factors, particulary vegetation diversity, were significantly related to summer species richness in both assemblage types. Lake area was also related to summer richness for both types, but the slope of the species-area regression was much steeper for Umbra-cypinid assemblages than for those in centrarchid-Esox lakes. Species richness relationships with winter oxygen concentration were negative in both seasons in Umbra-cyprinid lakes, but the relationship was positive for centrarchid-Esox assemblages in winter. A measure of lake connectedness was related to summer richness in centrarchid-Esox lakes. These patterns suggest that centrarchid-Esox assemblages are in ecological equilibrium but that a disturbance-induced disequilibrium occurs in Umbra-cyprinid assemblages.},

	Abstract = {Here we show that constructal-law physics unifies the design of animate and inanimate movement by requiring that larger bodies move farther, and their movement on the landscape last longer. The life span of mammals must scale as the body mass (M) raised to the power 1/4, and the distance traveled during the lifetime must increase with body size. The same size effect on life span and distance traveled holds for the other flows that move mass on earth: atmospheric and oceanic jets and plumes, river basins, animals and human operated vehicles. The physics is the same for all flow systems on the landscape: the scaling rules of ``design'' are expressions of the natural tendency of all flow systems to generate designs that facilitate flow access. This natural tendency is the constructal law of design and evolution in nature. Larger bodies are more efficient movers of mass on the landscape.},

@article{brown_determination_2014,
	Abstract = {Stable isotope ratios of particulate organic carbon ({POC}), together with other tracers, were analyzed in samples from the Canada Basin surface mixed layer in 2008 and 2009. Sampling was conducted during the end of the 2008 melt season and at the beginning of the 2009 freezeup under a variety of surface conditions, including open water, newly formed seasonal ice, and multiyear ice. In both years, {POC} exhibited a wide isotopic range (δ13C-{POC} −24.5 to −31.1‰), with the most isotopically depleted material generally found in the central basin. Isotopically enriched material was found on the shelves, consistent with higher biological production and strongly correlated with in situ carbon-uptake rates. In contrast, offshore in the central basin, there was no significant relationship between δ13C-{POC} distributions and either chlorophyll a or aqueous {CO}2 concentrations, suggesting that in situ biological production was not the dominant control. Analysis of freshwater sources suggested that the sea ice melt contribution of {POC} to surface waters in the central Canada Basin exerted a negligible influence on δ13C-{POC} distributions, and instead isotopically depleted {POC} in the surface waters of the central Canada Basin were sourced externally through advective transport of riverine organic matter. We show that alkalinity and meteoric water content can be used to distinguish {POC} inputs from North American and Russian rivers and our analysis suggests that Russian river inputs are the predominant source of 13C-depleted organic matter to the mixed layer of the central Canada Basin.},

	Abstract = {A new approach is proposed to separate the influence of source and topography in observed tsunami spectra and to reconstruct the initial source spectrum. The method assumes a linear tide gauge response to external forcing and is based on comparative analysis of tsunami and background spectra. Evaluation of the ratio of tsunami to background spectra gives functional characteristics that are invariant of station location and dependent only on the source parameters. Three events, the Urup tsunami of December 22, 1991 (northwest Pacific), the Hokkaido Southwest (Okushiri) tsunami of July 12, 1993 (Sea of Japan), and the Shikotan tsunami of October 4, 1994 (northwest Pacific), are used as examples of the proposed approach. The source spectra reconstructed from the analysis of different tide gauges were found to be in good agreement with each other and with the seismological, geodetic, and field survey data.},

	Abstract = {The behavior of 24-h average concentrations of particulate sulfate is investigated in relation to other aerometric variables for St. Louis and Salt Lake City. These cities were chosen to contrast and compare with Los Angeles and New York, which have been reported previously. The observations were examined statistically using a regression analysis of sulfate on Principal Components ({PC}) of the other aerometric variables. The {PCs} are associated with indications of the independent effects of atmospheric chemistry and dispersion, pollutant emissions and seasonal variations. The analysis showed major distinctions between sulfate dependence on aerometric variables in the four cities. These are interpreted in terms of differences in the influence of air transport, dispersion and atmospheric chemical processes. Sulfate levels in St. Louis are found to be highly correlated with a seasonal photochemical smog component which is very similar to that found in Los Angeles and New York City. In the dry climate of Salt Lake City, sulfate formation is a maximum in the winter rather than in the summer and appears to depend mainly on the relation between sources and synoptic meteorological conditions conducive to air stagnation, and trapping of pollution beneath a low inversion. The lack of a moist and photochemically-related contribution to sulfate variability and the winter sulfate maximum in Salt Lake City suggests that primary sulfate emissions are an influencing factor, or the predominant {SO}2 oxidation process is a heterogeneous one most active in winter air.},

@article{goodwin_predicting_1996,
	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The losses or degradation of coastal lagoons, tidal wetlands and small estuaries during the past century have been dramatic, exceeding 95\% in some areas of the U.S. There is now widespread concern by regulatory agencies, local governments and public interest groups to preserve remaining tidal wetlands and enhance or restore degraded coastal wetland systems. Many of the characteristics of these ecosystems are governed by the tidal inlet channels which control the tidal exchange, hydroperiod, salinity and water quality, and local flooding. The stability of tidal inlets in many coastal lagoon/tidal wetland systems in California has been altered during the past century due to changes in the watershed, confinement of the inlet channel, and filling or diking of regions of the behind the inlet. The stability of tidal inlets is of ecological concern since periodic closure results in prolonged inundation of foraging habitat; alterations in the salinity characteristics of the wetlands; poorer water quality; and the formation of barriers to fish passage. Therefore, in many saltmarsh enhancement/restoration projects, the stability of the tidal inlet is an important factor. The management objectives of tidal inlets for ecological enhancement differ from the traditional objectives such as navigation, since heavily engineered solutions to stabilize the inlet, or extensive maintenance dredging are usually undesirable. If the level of engineering intervention is to be minimized, it is important to develop an understanding of the natural physical processes at a particular site. A range of semi-empirical criteria for assessing the stability of small-scale natural inlets are reviewed and the sensitivity of these criteria to uncertainties in field data or assumptions in the analyses are discussed.},

@article{elwany_opening_1998,
	Abstract = {Over the past 50 yr, direct observations of the inlet status (open or closed) of San Dieguito Lagoon, a typical southern California lagoon located in Del Mar, California, have shown that river flooding is the major natural determinant of inlet conditions on time scales longer than a few years. River flooding is strongly dependent on rainfall in the San Dieguito River watershed and on the influences of two water storage reservoirs in the area. Rainfall fluctuates on yearly and longer time scales and undergoes cycles of wet and dry periods. Over short time periods, ranging from a few months to several years, inlet status is primarily determined by the available tidal prism and littoral sand transport. Recognition of these factors is crucial in order to correctly evaluate the probability that a small lagoon will remain open naturally. A probability approach is essential because the variables controlling inlet conditions are random in nature. The results of our study show that the inlet will remain open naturally 34\% of the time. The tendency to remain open is vastly smaller during years of dry weather (12\%) versus times of above-average rainfall (66\%).},

A nearshore observatory in Honolulu recorded clear signals of the surface elevation and flow velocity at 12 m water depth, where adjacent harbors and marinas experienced persistent hazardous surges. The measurements allow validation of numerical model results, which in turn reveal complex oscillation and flow patterns due to resonance over the insular shelf and reef system. The computed wave amplitude and flow speed increase from 0.4 m and 0.1 m/s at the 100-m depth contour to 1.6 m at the shore and 3.3 m/s near an entrance to Honolulu Harbor. Although resonance of the tsunami along the Hawaiian Islands produced the strongest surface signal at 42 min period, standing waves with periods 16 min or shorter, which are able to form nodes on the reefs, are the main driving force of the nearshore currents.},

Spectra of turbulence and the bursting phenomenon are also discussed. The oscillatory--planetary boundary layer in a shallow sea may be depth-limited, it will frequently exhibit significant thermal stratification effects, it may additionally be modified by sand-waves or sandbanks, and for non-uniform sediment distributions it may also develop an internal boundary layer. The boundary layer beneath tidal and other currents on the continental shelf exhibit many similarities with boundary layers in the atmosphere and the laboratory. Measurements of turbulence profiles would help to improve empirical expressions for the scaling of the spectral distribution of turbulent energy. Although considerable effort has gone into the study of the bursting phenomenon in its own right, especially in the laboratory, it still remains for a practical and usable method to be proposed that will incorporate the processes involved into a theoretical framework for the bottom boundary layer.},

@article{mazumder_formation_1995,
	Abstract = {In a tidal river, the peak value of the discharge occurs earlier than the peak value of the tidal elevation. The high water level of a tidal wave moves faster than the low water level, and as a result the slope of the wave-surface profile, in the direction of propagation, increases from high water to low and decreases from low water to high. This differential slope causes retention of tidal flux during ebb, which in turn elevates the low water level and introduces a delay in the occurrence of the low water phase. This delay causes the flood discharge, at the transition of flow from ebb to flood, to start with an initial value. During the passage of tides of large amplitudes, the delay angle and consequently the initial value of the flood discharge at the transition of flow from ebb to flood becomes large and generates a surge. This surge discharge, at the transition of flow from ebb to flood, generates the bore. This is possible only in rivers where the summation of the phase lead and delay angles exceeds π/2. The veracity of these computations is checked from observed data.},

These layers can propagate into the interior of the stratified fluid. This behaviour is also observed with intrusions at fronts between stratified bodies of fluid where their composition varies. We look at a simplified model of intrusion growth where the mechanism behind the creation of their well-mixed interiors is neglected, and look at how a stack of such intrusions will propagate away from the wall or front. We find that there is a transition from a regime where the propagation is essentially inviscid and the intrusion length is proportional to time, to one where viscosity is important and the propagation rate slows down, with the length being proportional to the square-root of time.},

Therefore, quantifying the longitudinal dispersion of scalars in the channel that results from tidal trapping was not possible using traditional frameworks, which assume that the exchange is a diffusive process. This study uses the concentration moment method to solve analytically for the dispersion coefficient of a solute in a tidal channel which exchanges advectively with volumes along its edges. This constitutes a new framework for analyzing the longitudinal dispersion that results from tidal trapping in systems such as a branching tidal channel or the breached salt ponds of San Francisco Bay. A comparison of dispersion coefficients from traditional, diffusion-driven frameworks for tidal trapping, the new advective framework derived in the present study, and observations show that the new formulation is best suited to this environment.},

@article{flinchem_introduction_2000,
	Abstract = {Continuous wavelet transforms ({CWTs}) provide an approach to understanding the numerous tidal phenomena that deviate markedly from an assumed statistical stationarity or exact periodicity inherent in traditional tidal methods. Use of wavelets allows determination of the degree of non-stationarity present in time series, such as estuarine and shelf currents, usually treated as stationary. Wavelets also provide a consistent analysis of tidal and non-tidal variance, a feature often essential for dynamical analyses of non-stationary tides. We summarize basic notions of the wavelet transform, also known as a perfect reconstruction filter bank or a multire solution analysis, contrast them with those of harmonic analysis and Fourier transforms, construct a continuous wavelet transform basis with a scale selection especially adapted to tidal problems, describe possibilities for analysis of scalar and vector quantities, define a criterion for knowledge of independence of process between adjoining scales, and illustrate use of wavelet tools with several examples. In contrast to the nearly periodic barotropic tide typical of coastal stations, this paper analyses processes that are in part tidally driven but non-stationary, e.g. baroclinic tidal currents, river tides, continental shelf internal tides, and some kinds of biological activity in the coastal ocean. In all cases, wavelet analysis provides a consistent, linear analysis of tidal and non-tidal variance and reveals features that harmonic analysis on a Fourier transform approach could not elucidate.},

This critical value was found to depend upon the value of interface thickness, and an empirical form for this dependence is presented. These results are discussed in the light of recent numerical computations of the shape of a very thin interface between the two layers at various values of the Froude number, and compared with previous results on this and the related three-dimensional problem of withdrawal through a single point. Suggestions are made for further research required to fully resolve this problem.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Conductivity, temperature and depth ({CTD}) measurements were recorded weekly at a fixed position in the shallow water of {\AA}rhus Bay over a period of 1 year. Variations in stratification and salinity are described in this study. Outflow of low salinity water from the Baltic Sea, and an estuarine return flow of high salinity bottom waters originating in the North Sea were observed. Strong stratification occurs during spring, summer and late autumn, whereas stratification is weak or absent during winter. A stratification model in terms of the potential energy of the water column ([phi]) has been applied including wind, solar insolation, estuarine circulation and current terms. Observations of stratification are very well described by this model, although considerable differences were found to occur during a period of very strong stratification. The interface is placed at a water depth of about 8 m during spring and early summer, and at a depth of about 12 m during autumn. A comparison of frequently used stratification parameters shows a highly positive correlation between [phi]and the density difference between surface and bottom water. A positive correlation between[phi]and Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} frequency was also found in periods of stable oceanographic and meteorological conditions, whereas no correlation was found in periods of unstable conditions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The losses or degradation of coastal lagoons, tidal wetlands and small estuaries during the past century have been dramatic, exceeding 95\% in some areas of the U.S. There is now widespread concern by regulatory agencies, local governments and public interest groups to preserve remaining tidal wetlands and enhance or restore degraded coastal wetland systems. Many of the characteristics of these ecosystems are governed by the tidal inlet channels which control the tidal exchange, hydroperiod, salinity and water quality, and local flooding. The stability of tidal inlets in many coastal lagoon/tidal wetland systems in California has been altered during the past century due to changes in the watershed, confinement of the inlet channel, and filling or diking of regions of the behind the inlet. The stability of tidal inlets is of ecological concern since periodic closure results in prolonged inundation of foraging habitat; alterations in the salinity characteristics of the wetlands; poorer water quality; and the formation of barriers to fish passage. Therefore, in many saltmarsh enhancement/restoration projects, the stability of the tidal inlet is an important factor. The management objectives of tidal inlets for ecological enhancement differ from the traditional objectives such as navigation, since heavily engineered solutions to stabilize the inlet, or extensive maintenance dredging are usually undesirable. If the level of engineering intervention is to be minimized, it is important to develop an understanding of the natural physical processes at a particular site. A range of semi-empirical criteria for assessing the stability of small-scale natural inlets are reviewed and the sensitivity of these criteria to uncertainties in field data or assumptions in the analyses are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the processes that influence residence time in a partially mixed estuary using a three-dimensional circulation model. The complex geometry of the study region is not optimal for a structured grid model and so we developed a new method of grid connectivity. This involves a novel approach that allows an unlimited number of individual grids to be combined in an efficient manner to produce a composite grid. We then implemented this new method into the numerical Regional Ocean Modeling System ({ROMS}) and developed a composite grid of the Hudson River estuary region to investigate the residence time of a passive tracer. Results show that the residence time is a strong function of the time of release (spring vs. neap tide), the along-channel location, and the initial vertical placement. During neap tides there is a maximum in residence time near the bottom of the estuary at the mid-salt intrusion length. During spring tides the residence time is primarily a function of along-channel location and does not exhibit a strong vertical variability. This model study of residence time illustrates the utility of the grid connectivity method for circulation and dispersion studies in regions of complex geometry.},

	Abstract = {A three-dimensional circulation model with a relatively simple dissolved oxygen model is used to examine the role that physical forcing has on controlling hypoxia and anoxia in Chesapeake Bay. The model assumes that the biological utilization of dissolved oxygen is constant in both time and space, isolating the role that physical forces play in modulating oxygen dynamics. Despite the simplicity of the model, it demonstrates skill in reproducing the observed variability of dissolved oxygen in the bay, highlighting the important role that variations in physical forcing have on the seasonal cycle of hypoxia. Model runs demonstrate significant changes in the annual integrated hypoxic volume as a function of river discharge, water temperature, and wind speed and direction. Variations in wind speed and direction had the greatest impact on the observed seasonal cycle of hypoxia and large impacts on the annually integrated hypoxic volume. The seasonal cycle of hypoxia was relatively insensitive to synoptic variability in river discharge, but integrated hypoxic volumes were sensitive to the overall magnitude of river discharge at annual time scales. Increases in river discharge were shown to increase hypoxic volumes, independent from the associated biological response to higher nutrient delivery. However, increases in hypoxic volume were limited at very high river discharge because increased advective fluxes limited the overall length of the hypoxic region. Changes in water temperature and its control on dissolved oxygen saturation were important to both the seasonal cycle of hypoxia and the overall magnitude of hypoxia in a given year.},

@article{bruneau_future_2011,
	Abstract = {Tidal inlets are extremely dynamic, as a result of an often delicate balance between the effects of tides, waves and other forcings. Since the morphology of these inlets can affect navigation, water quality and ecosystem dynamics, there is a clear need to anticipate their evolution in order to promote adequate management decisions. Over decadal time scales, the position and size of tidal inlets are expected to evolve with the conditions that affect them, for instance as a result of climate change. A process-based morphodynamic modeling system is validated and used to analyze the effects of sea level rise, an expected shift in the wave direction and the reduction of the upper lagoon surface area by sedimentation on a small tidal inlet ({\'O}bidos lagoon, Portugal). A new approach to define yearly wave regimes is first developed, which includes a seasonal behavior, random inter-annual variability and the possibility to extrapolate trends. Once validated, this approach is used to produce yearly time series of wave spectra for the present and for the end of the 21st century, considering the local rotation trends computed using hindcast results for the past 57 years. Predictions of the mean sea level for 2100 are based on previous studies, while the bathymetry of the upper lagoon for the same year is obtained by extrapolation of past trends. Results show, and data confirm, that the {\'O}bidos lagoon inlet has three stable configurations, largely determined by the inter-annual variations in the wave characteristics. Both sea level rise and the reduction of the lagoon surface area will promote the accretion of the inlet. In contrast, the predicted rotation of the wave regime, within foreseeable limits, will have a negligible impact on the inlet morphology.},

	Abstract = {The coupled ocean--atmosphere--wave--sediment transport ({COAWST}) modeling system was used to investigate atmosphere--ocean--wave interactions in November 2009 during Hurricane Ida and its subsequent evolution to Nor'Ida, which was one of the most costly storm systems of the past two decades. One interesting aspect of this event is that it included two unique atmospheric extreme conditions, a hurricane and a nor'easter storm, which developed in regions with different oceanographic characteristics. Our modeled results were compared with several data sources, including {GOES} satellite infrared data, {JASON}-1 and {JASON}-2 altimeter data, {CODAR} measurements, and wave and tidal information from the National Data Buoy Center ({NDBC}) and the National Tidal Database. By performing a series of numerical runs, we were able to isolate the effect of the interaction terms between the atmosphere (modeled with Weather Research and Forecasting, the {WRF} model), the ocean (modeled with Regional Ocean Modeling System ({ROMS})), and the wave propagation and generation model (modeled with Simulating Waves Nearshore ({SWAN})). Special attention was given to the role of the ocean surface roughness. Three different ocean roughness closure models were analyzed: {DGHQ} (which is based on wave age), {TY}2001 (which is based on wave steepness), and {OOST} (which considers both the effects of wave age and steepness). Including the ocean roughness in the atmospheric module improved the wind intensity estimation and therefore also the wind waves, surface currents, and storm surge amplitude. For example, during the passage of Hurricane Ida through the Gulf of Mexico, the wind speeds were reduced due to wave-induced ocean roughness, resulting in better agreement with the measured winds. During Nor'Ida, including the wave-induced surface roughness changed the form and dimension of the main low pressure cell, affecting the intensity and direction of the winds. The combined wave age- and wave steepness-based parameterization ({OOST}) provided the best results for wind and wave growth prediction. However, the best agreement between the measured ({CODAR}) and computed surface currents and storm surge values was obtained with the wave steepness-based roughness parameterization ({TY}2001), although the differences obtained with respect to {DGHQ} were not significant. The influence of sea surface temperature ({SST}) fields on the atmospheric boundary layer dynamics was examined; in particular, we evaluated how the {SST} affects wind wave generation, surface currents and storm surges. The integrated hydrograph and integrated wave height, parameters that are highly correlated with the storm damage potential, were found to be highly sensitive to the ocean surface roughness parameterization.},

	Abstract = {This study documents the development of a beach berm and the associated closure of an intermittently open coastal lagoon on a gently sloping beach on the east coast of Australia. The berm grew 1.17 m in elevation over 11 days, and essentially closed the lagoon except at high tide within 4 days after opening. Berm growth was vertical with no notable horizontal accretion in the shore normal direction. Wave runup and overtopping were also measured and overtopping into the lagoon channel was found to be dominated by long waves. Berm development is found to be largely dependant upon swash and overtopping potential. Large overtopping potential at the start of the experiment resulted in substantial sediment transport, deposition and rapid berm growth. With berm growth, overtopping potential ultimately become restricted, reducing the sediment volumes deposited and consequently limiting further berm growth.},

@incollection{baldock_berm_????,
	Abstract = {This study documents the development of a beach berm and the associated closure of an intermittently open coastal lagoon on a gently sloping beach on the east coast of Australia. The berm grew 1.17 m in elevation over 11 days, and essentially closed the lagoon except at high tide within 4 days after opening. Berm growth was vertical with no notable horizontal accretion in the shore normal direction. Wave runup and overtopping were also measured and overtopping into the lagoon channel was found to be dominated by long waves. Berm development is found to be largely dependant upon swash and overtopping potential. Large overtopping potential at the start of the experiment resulted in substantial sediment transport, deposition and rapid berm growth. With berm growth, overtopping potential ultimately become restricted, reducing the sediment volumes deposited and consequently limiting further berm growth.},

	Abstract = {Infragravity waves, motions with frequencies immediately below wind-generated sea and swell, are believed to be radiated seaward from the surf zone, where they are excited by nonlinear interactions between waves in the sea-swell frequency band. We describe tidal modulation of sea surface elevation variance at infragravity frequencies observed in 8--30 m water depth, a few kilometers from shore at several California sites. Infragravity spectral levels vary by as much as a factor of 10 between high and low tide, possibly because the surf zone width and beach face slope vary significantly with tidal level on the usually concave-shaped beaches onshore of the observations. At a fixed sensor and with approximately constant sea-swell energy, the observed infragravity energy is lowest at low tide.},

	Abstract = {The present study proposes prediction formulae both for random wave runup and mean overtopping discharge at seawalls constructed on land or in very shallow water. Although several existing formulae for runup and overtopping employ the incident wave characteristics at the toes of seawalls, this study adopts the equivalent deep-water wave characteristics and an imaginary seawall slope for easy application of the formulae, especially to seawalls constructed on land. The prediction formulae for overtopping use the predicted runup values. For the wave runup prediction formulae two sets of experimental data are used: a new set of data and Mase et al.'s (2004) data. For the wave overtopping prediction formulae Tamada et al.'s (2002) experimental data are used. Comparisons with measurements show good performances of both new prediction methods.},

@article{apotsos_wave_2011,
	Abstract = {While the destruction caused by a tsunami can vary significantly owing to near- and onshore controls, we have only a limited quantitative understanding of how different local parameters influence the onshore response of tsunamis. Here, a numerical model based on the non-linear shallow water equations is first shown to agree well with analytical expressions developed for periodic long waves inundating over planar slopes. More than 13,000 simulations are then conducted to examine the effects variations in the wave characteristics, bed slopes, and bottom roughness have on maximum tsunami run-up and water velocity at the still water shoreline. While deviations from periodic waves and planar slopes affect the onshore dynamics, the details of these effects depend on a combination of factors. In general, the effects differ for breaking and non-breaking waves, and are related to the relative shift of the waves along the breaking--non-breaking wave continuum. Variations that shift waves toward increased breaking, such as steeper wave fronts, tend to increase the onshore impact of non-breaking waves, but decrease the impact of already breaking waves. The onshore impact of a tsunami composed of multiple waves can be different from that of a single wave tsunami, with the largest difference occurring on long, shallow onshore topographies. These results demonstrate that the onshore response of a tsunami is complex, and that using analytical expressions derived from simplified conditions may not always be appropriate.},

@article{whitfield_multidisciplinary_2008,
	Abstract = {In 2005/2006 a multidisciplinary research programme that included   studies on the hydrodynamics, sediment dynamics, macronutrients,   microalgae, macrophytes, zoobenthos, hyperbenthos, zooplankton,   ichthyo-plankton, fish and birds of the temporarily open/closed East   Kleinemonde Estuary was conducted. Particular attention was given to the   responses of the different ecosystem components to the opening and   closing of the estuary mouth and how this is driven by both riverine and   marine events. Using a complementary dataset of daily estuary mouth   conditions spanning a 14-year period, five distinct phases of the   estuary were identified, including closed ( average = 90\% of the days),   outflow ({\textless}1\%), tidal (9\%) and semi-closed ({\textless}1\%). The open-mouth phase is   critical for the movements of a number of estuary-associated fish ( e.   g. Rhabdosargus holubi) and invertebrates ( e. g. Scylla serrata)   between the estuary and sea. The timing of this open phase has a direct   influence on the ability of certain estuary-associated fish ( e. g.   Lithognathus lithognathus) and invertebrates ( e. g. Palaemon   peringueyi) to successfully recruit into the system, with a spring   opening (October/November) being regarded as optimal for most species.   The type of mouth-breaching event and outflow phase is also important in   terms of the subsequent salinity regime once the berm barrier forms. A   deep mouth breaching following a large river flood tends to result in   major tidal inputs of marine water prior to mouth closure and therefore   higher salinities (15-25). Conversely, a shallow mouth breaching with   reduced tidal exchange during the open phase often leads to a much lower   salinity regime at the time of mouth closure (5-15). The biota,   especially the submerged macrophytes, respond very differently to the   above two scenarios, with Ruppia cirrhosa benefiting from the former and   Potamogeton pectinatus from the latter. River flooding and the   associated outflow of large volumes of water through the estuary can   result in major declines in zooplankton, zoobenthos, hyperbenthos and   fish populations during this phase. However, this resetting of the   estuary is necessary because certain marine invertebrate and fish   species are dependent on the opening of the estuary mouth in order to   facilitate recruitment of larvae and post-larvae into the system from   the sea. Slight increases in the numbers of certain piscivorous and   resident wading bird species were recorded when the estuary mouth   opened, possibly linked to increased feeding opportunities during that   phase.},

@article{johnson_transient_2004,
	Abstract = {[1] Eulerian and Lagrangian measurements of nearshore circulation on a longshore uniform beach with perpendicularly incident swell waves are described. Both the Eulerian and Lagrangian data show a variable rotational part of the current field that is distinct from, but coexists with, that due to infragravity waves. A well-defined feature of the flow field includes transient rip currents, which occur in varying locations and are not topographically controlled. Drifter trajectories show that the rips behave like a shallow plane jet, consisting of a constrained neck region that flows into a spreading head region. There is continuous modulation of the flow within the rip neck. Estimates of the length scale across the rip neck using two-particle statistics are 20 - 30 m. Well-defined discrete vortex features are observed at the initiation point of one of the necks and in one of the rip heads. Estimated dispersion values suggest that mixing is greatly enhanced outside the surf zone by the intermittent presence of the rip heads. The dispersion calculated from both inside and outside the surf zone appears to show scale dependence with a power law close to 4/3 in a similar way to oceanic turbulence at much larger scales.},

@article{macmahan_fortnightly_????,
	Abstract = {Amplitudes of semi-diurnal tidal fluctuations measured at an ocean inlet system decay nearly linearly by 87\% between the ocean edge of the offshore ebb-tidal delta and the backbay. A monochromatic, dynamical model for a tidally choked inlet separately reproduces the evolution of the amplitudes and phases of the semi-diurnal and diurnal tidal constituents observed between the ocean and inland locations. However, the monochromatic model over-predicts the amplitude and under-predicts the lag of the lower-frequency subtidal and fortnightly motions observed in the backbay. A dimensional model that considers all tidal constituents simultaneously, balances the along-channel pressure gradient with quadratic bottom friction, and that includes a time-varying channel water depth, is used to show that that these model-data differences are associated with nonlinear interactions between the tidal constituents that are not included in non-dimensional, monochromatic models. In particular, numerical simulations suggest that the nonlinear interactions induced by quadratic bottom friction modify the amplitude and phase of the subtidal and fortnightly backbay response. This nonlinear effect on the low-frequency (subtidal and fortnightly) motions increases with increasing high-frequency (semi-diurnal) amplitude. The subtidal and fortnightly motions influence water exchange processes, and thus backbay temperature and salinity.},

@article{farmer_tilting_2002,
	Abstract = {Observations of a front associated with boundary layer separation from a headland illustrate a mechanism by which horizontal density gradients create intense turbulence and vertical mixing, thus, contributing to water property modification in the coastal zone. Tidal current past an island separates from the coast, creating a shear zone between the primary flow and the slowly moving water in the lee of the island. The density structure on either side of the front may differ due to different origins or degrees of prior mixing. Consequently, there can be horizontal density gradients across the front. Boundary layer separation from the headland begins as a vertical vortex sheet on which instabilities grow to form a sequence of eddies. The presence of horizontal density gradients causes the shear layer to tilt. Tilting and stretching of the sheared flow generates intense circulation. Whirlpools and boils appear at the surface accompanied by vertical motions in which broad areas of upwelling alternate with narrow areas of downwelling. These mix the water throughout its depth; bubbles entrained at the surface reach depths of over 120 m. Such violent mixing weakens stratification associated with the estuarine circulation and aerates water masses passing through the area.},

	Abstract = {We examine tidal asymmetry in a 100-km long coastal plain estuary, a 15-km long tidal creek closed at the end, and a small side channel of a coastal plain estuary closed at low water. Current meter and water depth data were harmonically analyzed for M2 and the M4 and M6 overtide. The results are displayed in a plot of tidal current versus water level and the effects of the M2, M2+M4, and M2+M4+M6 are compared in order to show how overtides affect tidal asymmetry in the different systems.

The long estuary showed a gradual increase in tidal current asymmetry. The current takes on a more progressive nature as it goes into the estuary, as indicated by increasing lags between high or low water and the corresponding slack water. On the other hand, the tidal creek has its reflection point at the head, a relatively short distance from the observations, which reflects the incident tidal wave more efficiently.

The tidal creek has a high salt marsh which is covered only an hour or so before high water. Since its intertidal areas flood and drain near the time of high water, maximum flood and ebb currents occur a short time before and after high water slack throughout the tidal creek. Most of the tidal energy is dissipated at the end of the creek where M6/M2 of the tidal current almost doubles.

The small side channel has tidal flats that become covered soon after the time of low water. The relative time of maximum flood and ebb currents occurs much closer to the time of low-water-slack, which contrasts significantly to the timing in the tidal creek channel surrounded by high salt marsh.},

@article{ralston_effects_2013,
	Abstract = {Tidal flats at a river mouth feature estuarine and fluvial processes that distinguish them from tidal flats without river discharge. We combine field observations and a numerical model to investigate hydrodynamics and sediment transport on deltaic tidal flats at the mouth of the Skagit River, in Puget Sound, {WA}, during the spring freshet. River discharge over tidal flats supplies a mean volume flux, freshwater buoyancy, and suspended sediment. Despite the shallow water depths, strong horizontal density fronts and stratification develop, resulting in a baroclinic pressure gradient and tidal variability in stratification that favor flood-directed bottom stresses. In addition to these estuarine processes, the river discharge during periods of low tide drains through a network of distributary channels on the exposed tidal flats, with strongly ebb-directed stresses. The net sediment transport depends on the balance between estuarine and fluvial processes, and is modulated on a spring-neap time scale by the tides of Puget Sound. We find that the baroclinic pressure gradient and periodic stratification enhance trapping of sediment delivered by the river on the tidal flats, particularly during neap tides, and that sediment trapping also depends on settling and scour lags, particularly for finer particles. The primary means of moving sediment off of the tidal flats are the high velocities and stresses in the distributary channels during late stages of ebbs and around low tides, with sediment export predominantly occurring during spring low tides that expose a greater portion of the flats. The 3-d finite volume numerical model was evaluated against observations and had good skill overall, particularly for velocity and salinity. The model performed poorly at simulating the shallow flows around low tides as the flats drained and river discharge was confined to distributary channels, due in part to limitations in grid resolution, seabed sediment and bathymetric data, and the wetting-and-drying scheme. Consequently, the model predicted greater sediment retention on the flats than was observed.},

@article{cheng_tidal_1993,
	Abstract = {A numerical model using a semi-implicit finite-difference method for solving the two-dimensional shallow-water equations is presented. The gradient of the water surface elevation in the momentum equations and the velocity divergence in the continuity equation are finite-differenced implicitly, the remaining terms are finite-differenced explicitly. The convective terms are treated using an Eulerian-Lagrangian method. The combination of the semi-implicit finite-difference solution for the gravity wave propagation, and the Eulerian-Lagrangian treatment of the convective terms renders the numerical model unconditionally stable. When the baroclinic forcing is included, a salt transport equation is coupled to the momentum equations, and the numerical method is subject to a weak stability condition. The method of solution and the properties of the numerical model are given.
This numerical model is particularly suitable for applications to coastal plain estuaries and tidal embayments in which tidal currents are dominant, and tidally generated residual currents are important. The model is applied to San Francisco Bay, California where extensive historical tides and current-meter data are available. The model calibration is considered by comparing time-series of the field data and of the model results. Alternatively, and perhaps more meaningfully, the model is calibrated by comparing the harmonic constants of tides and tidal currents derived from field data with those derived from the model. The model is further verified by comparing the model results with an independent data set representing the wet season. The strengths and the weaknesses of the model are assessed based on the results of model calibration and verification. Using the model results, the properties of tides and tidal currents in San Francisco Bay are characterized and discussed. Furthermore, using the numerical model, estimates of San Francisco Bay's volume, surface area, mean water depth, tidal prisms, and tidal excursions at spring and neap tides are computed. Additional applications of the model reveal, qualitatively the spatial distribution of residual variables.},

	Abstract = {Effects of Potamogeton perfoliatus on N transformations in sediments were examined with 15N isotope techniques. Rates of ammonification, nitrification, denitrification, and plant uptake of nitrogen were measured in intact sediments with and without P. perfoliatus twice during the growing season (May and July). Sediments were injected with 15NH 4 + and the appearance of 15N over time in overlying water, pore water, and plant tissues was measured. Most of the 15N added was recovered. Rates of bacterial {NH}4 + utilization (including {NH}4 + assimilation and nitrification) were similar to gross ammonification rates in vegetated and bare sediments, although rates were highly variable. Root (and rhizome) uptake represented \${\textbackslash}thicksim 90\%\$ of total N uptake by the plants in May, but only 20\% in July. Tissue-specific (root or shoot) uptake rates were similar in May and July, although shoot (leaves plus stems) biomass increased faster than root biomass from May to July. Between 70 and 75\% of the N taken up by roots was translocated to shoots. Denitrification rates, calculated from the appearance of 15N-N2 in the overlying and pore water, were significantly greater in vegetated than in bare sediments in July. Nitrification and denitrification were closely coupled, and denitrification in the root zone represented \${\textbackslash}thicksim 16\%\$ of total denitrification. In vegetated sediments, \${\textbackslash}thicksim 75\%\$ of the 15N lost from sediments was denitrified, and 25\% was taken up by the plants. P. perfoliatus had a significant influence on sediment N cycling by direct uptake of {NH}4 + and {NO}3 - and by indirect mechanisms leading to enhanced nitrification and denitrification.},

	Abstract = {A new approach is proposed to separate the influence of source and topography in observed tsunami spectra and to reconstruct the initial source spectrum. The method assumes a linear tide gauge response to external forcing and is based on comparative analysis of tsunami and background spectra. Evaluation of the ratio of tsunami to background spectra gives functional characteristics that are invariant of station location and dependent only on the source parameters. Three events, the Urup tsunami of December 22, 1991 (northwest Pacific), the Hokkaido Southwest (Okushiri) tsunami of July 12, 1993 (Sea of Japan), and the Shikotan tsunami of October 4, 1994 (northwest Pacific), are used as examples of the proposed approach. The source spectra reconstructed from the analysis of different tide gauges were found to be in good agreement with each other and with the seismological, geodetic, and field survey data.},

@article{fortunato_effect_1999,
	Abstract = {The effects of tidal flats on the hydrodynamics of the Tagus estuary are analysed using an accurate high-resolution shallow water model, supported by field data. Tidal flats act mainly as energy filters, rather than sinks, transferring energy from astronomic to non-linear frequencies. They also play a major role in determining the strong resonance mode that amplifies semi-diurnal constituents. We show that the upper estuary, with extensive tidal flats, has an increasing accretion rate. This ``filling-up'' results from a positive feedback between sediment deposition and the hydrodynamics: accretion in the upper estuary lengthens the duration of ebbs, decreasing sediment flushing and further increasing accretion.

	Abstract = {We used a simple energy balance equation, and estimates of the cross-shore energy flux carried by progressive surf beat, to calculate the rate of net surf beat forcing (or dissipation) on a beach near Duck, North Carolina. Far inside the surf zone, surf beat dissipation exceeded forcing. Outside the surf zone, surf beat forcing exceeded dissipation. When incident waves were large, surf beat dissipation inside the surf zone and forcing just outside the surf zone were both very strong (the surf beat energy dissipated in the surf zone in a single beat period was of the same order as the total amount of surf beat energy stored in the surf zone). During storms, shoreward propagation of surf beat maintained surf beat energy in the surf zone. Net surf beat dissipation in the surf zone scaled as predicted by a simple bottom stress parameterization. The inferred dissipation factor for surf beat was 0.08, within the range of wave dissipation factors usually observed in the field and 27--80 times larger than drag coefficients appropriate for the mean longshore current. The observed rapid forcing, rapid dissipation, and shoreward propagation of surf beat are not simulated by existing models of surf beat dynamics.},

@article{stanley_stratification_1992,
	Abstract = {Relationships among bottom-water dissolved oxygen ({DO}), vertical stratification, and the factors responsible for stratification-destratification in this shallow, low tidal-energy estuary were studied using a 15-yr set of biweekly measurements, along with some recent continuous-monitoring data. Hypoxia develops only when there is both vertical water-column stratification and warm water temperature ({\textgreater}15$\,^{\circ}$C). In July, 75\% of the {DO} readings were {\textless}5 mg 1−1, and one-third were {\textless}1 mg 1−1. Severe hypoxia occurs more frequently in the upper half of the estuary than near the mouth. Both the time series data and correlation analysis results indicate that stratification events and {DO} levels are tightly coupled with variations in freshwater discharge and wind stress. Stratification can form or disappear in a matter of hours, and episodes lasting from one to several days seem to be common. Estimated summertime respiration rates in the water and sediments are sufficient to produce hypoxia if the water is mixed only every 6--12 d. There has been no trend toward lower bottom water {DO} in the Pamlico River Estuary over the past 15 yr. *** {DIRECT} {SUPPORT} *** A01BY059 00002},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Australia's largest river, the River Murray, discharges to the southern ocean through a coastal lagoon and river-dominated tidal inlet. Increased water extractions upstream for irrigation have led to significantly reduced flows at the mouth and, as a result, the area is undergoing rapid change, particularly with regard to the rate at which sediment is being transported into the lagoon. Based on detailed and accurate bathymetric surveys it has been possible to estimate that the rate of lagoon in-filling is of the order of 100,000 m3 per year for the period June 2000 to May 2003, although the actual rate shows significant year to year variability. Dredging of the lagoon commenced in 2000 in an attempt to reverse the trend.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}In an effort to understand the behaviour of the inlet a one-dimensional numerical model of the inlet has been developed. The model extends the original of van de Kreeke by including a dynamic inlet throat area based on predicted river flows and a sediment transport module to predict the resulting net sediment transport. Comparisons with water level data collected on both the ocean and lagoon sides of the mouth have shown that the model is able to predict the attenuation and lag of the tidal signal reasonably well. The sediment transport model was based on predicted sediment concentrations in the surf zone and was found to predict the rate of sediment in-filling to an acceptable level of accuracy. It is envisaged that the model will be a useful management tool, especially since it is possible to manipulate river discharges to the mouth.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {Summary The nature of estuarine circulation under highly stratified conditions is reviewed in the context of southern African estuaries that are small and have a constricted connection to the ocean. While the focus is on the generic hydrodynamic processes and features, attention is given to field observations from a particular estuary as a way of illustrating these processes and features. Notable features are the tidal intrusion front, the bottom density current and the long-residence deep water in the upper estuary. The important hydrodynamic processes, which account for these features, are internal hydraulic control of exchange through the mouth, buoyancy-driven landward intrusion of sea water, upward shear-driven entrainment and ebb tidal outflow. The context in which these processes and features are expected to occur is addressed through a discussion of seasonal variations in the prototype and through a discussion of these features observed in other southern African estuaries. A distinction is made between those systems that are permanently highly stratified and those that display highly stratified phases. The ecological and management implications of strong stratification in an estuary are discussed briefly.},

@article{dunton_food_2012-1,
	Abstract = {The eastern Alaska Beaufort Sea coast is characterized by numerous shallow (2--5 m) estuarine lagoons, fed by streams and small rivers that drain northward from the Brooks Range through the arctic coastal plain, and bounded seaward by barrier islands and shoals. Millions of birds from six continents nest and forage during the summer period in this region using the river deltas, lagoons, and shoreline along with several species of anadromous and marine fish. We examined biogeochemical processes linking the benthic community to the overall food web structure of these poorly studied but pristine estuaries, which are largely covered by 1.8 m of ice for 10 months annually. In summer, these lagoons are relatively warm with brackish salinities (5--10$\,^{\circ}$C, S = 10--25) compared to more open coastal waters (0--5$\,^{\circ}$C, S {\textgreater} 27). The stable isotopic composition of organic materials in sediments (i.e., benthic particulate organic matter) and water column suspended particulate organic matter from both streams and lagoons are largely indistinguishable and reflect strong terrestrial contributions, based upon δ13C and δ15N values (−25.6‰ to −27.4‰ and 1.4‰ to 3.3‰, respectively). By comparison, shifts toward more heavy isotope-enriched organic materials reflecting marine influence are observed on the adjacent coastal shelf (−24.8‰ to −25.4‰ and 3.4‰ to 5.3‰, respectively). The isotopic composition of lagoon fauna is consistent with a food web dominated by omnivorous detritovores strongly dependent on microbial processing of terrestrial sources of carbon. Biomagnification of 15N in benthic organisms indicate that the benthic food web in lagoons support up to four trophic levels, with carnivorous gastropod predators and benthic fishes (δ15N values up to 14.4‰) at the apex.},

@article{lynett_observations_2012,
	Abstract = {Tsunamis, or ``harbor waves'' in Japanese, are so-named due to common observations of enhanced wave heights, currents and damage in harbors and ports. However, dynamic currents induced by these waves, while regularly observed and known to cause significant damage, are poorly understood. Observations and modeling of the currents induced by the 2011 Tohoku and 2004 Indian Ocean tsunamis allows us to show that the strongest flows in harbor basins are governed by horizontally sheared and rotational shallow features, such as jets and large eddies. When examining currents in harbors, this conclusion will generally require a simulation approach that both includes the relevant physical processes in the governing equations and uses a numerical scheme that does not artificially damp these features. Without proper representation of the physics associated with these phenomena, predictive models may provide drag force estimates that are an order of magnitude or more in error. The immediate implementation of this type of analysis into tsunami hazard studies can mean the difference between an unaffected port and one in which 300 m long container vessels are detached from their moorings and drift chaotically.},

@article{swenson_ecology_1999,
	Abstract = {Understanding the ecology and behavior of endangered species, such as the tidewater goby, Eucyclogobius newberryi, is important for identifying problems and formulating solutions for species recovery. The tidewater goby forms isolated populations in California's coastal lagoons, creeks, and marshes. Rapid declines in the number of populations led to its listing as an endangered species in 1994. This benthic fish prefers stillwater habitats and feeds on small invertebrates. It is an annual species with an extended breeding season. Fish are larger in marsh habitats than in lagoon or creek habitats. The male digs a spawning burrow, preferably in sand, where he provides care for a single clutch. The tidewater goby is sex-role reversed: females compete more intensely than males for access to mates. The tidewater goby is a species at risk, in part due to narrow habitat preferences, isolation of populations, short lifespan, lack of marine dispersal, and vulnerability to introduced predatory fishes. Attributes that favor its recovery include euryhaline tolerances, rapid reproductive rate, its potential for opportunistic feeding, and the possibility of natural recolonization under certain circumstances. Potential conservation measures include protecting coastal marshes that adjoin creeks and lagoons, maintaining natural hydrologic regimes, preventing artificial breaching of the sandbar at the estuary's mouth, and preventing introductions of predatory fishes. Captive breeding and reintroduction of tidewater gobies are potential tools for recovery, provided that underlying problems of habitat availability and suitability and issues of genetic integrity and disease transmission are addressed. Further research into the tidewater goby's utilization of marsh habitats, dispersal mechanisms, response to artificial breaching events, and metapopulation genetics would provide additional information for management.},

	Abstract = {The propagation of infragravity waves (ocean surface waves with periods from 20 to 200 s) over complex inner shelf (water depths from about 3 to 50 m) bathymetry is investigated with field observations from the southern California coast. A wave-ray-path-based model is used to describe radiation from adjacent beaches, refraction over slopes (smooth changes in bathymetry), and partial reflection from submarine canyons (sharp changes in bathymetry). In both the field observations and the model simulations the importance of the canyons depends on the directional spectrum of the infragravity wave field radiating from the shoreline and on the distance from the canyons. Averaged over the wide range of conditions observed, a refraction-only model has reduced skill near the abrupt bathymetry, whereas a combined refraction and reflection model accurately describes the distribution of infragravity wave energy on the inner shelf, including the localized effects of steep-walled submarine canyons.},

	Abstract = {This study investigated a model of predictors of higher level career aspirations among 2 groups of women: students in mathematics, physical science, and engineering majors and students in biological science majors. On the basis of social-cognitive theory, it was hypothesized that ability, self-efficacy, positivity of role model influence, and role conflict would influence the higher level career aspirations of these women. Data obtained from a mail survey of 546 students revealed that the hypothesized model provided a good overall fit to the data. In contrast to the women in math, physical science, and engineering majors, the relationships between ability and self-efficacy and between positivity of role-model influence and self-efficacy were significantly lower in magnitude for women in the biological sciences group. These findings suggest ideas for interventions designed to increase the number of women aspiring to top positions within nontraditional careers.},

@article{schwartz_holocene_1986,
	Abstract = {Elkhorn Slough is California's second largest estuary and the United States' first estuarine sanctuary. It occupies the western reaches of Elkhorn Valley, a relic river valley eroded by drainage pouring out of the Santa Clara and/or Great Valley of California into Monterey Bay during the early Pleistocene. During the mid-late Pleistocene Elkhorn Valley was tectonically truncated from its headwaters by right-lateral movement along the San Andreas Fault.

During the last glacial maximum, 16--18 × 103 years before present (b.p), local drainage in Elkhorn Valley incised a stream channel at least 29 m below present day sea-level, as its base level was progressively lowered. With the ensuing Holocene sea-level rise, marine waters invaded this incised channel, floored with non-marine sandy gravels, creating a high-energy tidal inlet at the mouth of Elkhorn Slough approximately 8000 years b.p. As sea-level continued to rise, the main channel of Elkhorn Slough became filled by an estuarine, fining-upward sequence characterized by progressively shallower, lower-energy deposits. A quiet water estuary, considerably larger than the present-day Elkhorn Slough, existed approximately 3000 years b.p. As the Slough was slowly filling, salt marshes developed along its landward margins and have progressively advanced toward the center of the Slough during the past 5000 years.

Historical records indicate numerous natural changes in the Elkhorn Slough vicinity. In the mid-1850s a.d. Elkhorn Slough was a minor tributary to the much larger Pajaro-Salinas River system which shared a common entrance to the Pacific Ocean north of Moss Landing. In 1909 winter storms modified the course of the Salinas River to its present location south of Moss Landing, while Elkhorn Slough persisted as a tributary to the Old Salinas River channel. Construction of jetties at the Moss Landing Harbor in 1946 provided a direct link between the Pacific Ocean and Elkhorn Slough. At this time, salt marshes began to retreat from the axis of Elkhorn Slough as it evolved into its present form as a relatively stable estuarine embayment. Had the jetties not been installed, Elkhorn Slough would have likely evolved into a freshwater wetland and eventually into a dry alluvial valley within 2000 years. The future fate of Elkhorn Slough will undoubtedly be controlled by relative sea-level changes, sediment supply, and human activities.},

	Abstract = {The dominant hydrodynamic forcing and resulting sediment transport mechanisms in the swash zone are reviewed, combined with a discussion of future measurement and modelling requirements. The importance of swash zone processes in the overall behaviour of the nearshore littoral zone are identified, with the paper subsequently focusing on aspects that directly relate to sediment transport on beaches. The review considers analytical and numerical modelling work, and both field and laboratory data. The hydrodynamics of the swash zone are first discussed with reference to the surf zone boundary, swash characteristics, forcing mechanisms and shoreline oscillations. Subsequent sections consider more micro-scale processes such as the internal flow kinematics, turbulence, the bed boundary layer and infiltration/exfiltration through permeable beds. The second part of the paper outlines the fundamental mechanics of sediment transport in the swash zone, followed by a more detailed discussion of sediment transport modes induced by the dominant hydrodynamic conditions. Modelling concepts are reviewed, and the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches identified. A final summary and future modelling perspectives conclude the paper.},

	Abstract = {The influence of eelgrass (Zostera marina) on near-bed currents, turbulence, and drag was investigated at three sites in two eelgrass canopies of differing density and at one unvegetated site in the San Juan archipelago of Puget Sound, Washington, {USA}. Eelgrass blade length exceeded 1 m. Velocity profiles up to 1.5 m above the sea floor were collected over a spring-neap tidal cycle with a downward-looking pulse-coherent acoustic Doppler profiler above the canopies and two acoustic Doppler velocimeters within the canopies. The eelgrass attenuated currents by a minimum of 40\%, and by more than 70\% at the most densely vegetated site. Attenuation decreased with increasing current speed. The data were compared to the shear-layer model of vegetated flows and the displaced logarithmic model. Velocity profiles outside the meadows were logarithmic. Within the canopies, most profiles were consistent with the shear-layer model, with a logarithmic layer above the canopy. However, at the less-dense sites, when currents were strong, shear at the sea floor and above the canopy was significant relative to shear at the top of the canopy, and the velocity profiles more closely resembled those in a rough-wall boundary layer. Turbulence was strong at the canopy top and decreased with height. Friction velocity at the canopy top was 1.5--2 times greater than at the unvegetated, sandy site. The coefficient of drag {CD} on the overlying flow derived from the logarithmic velocity profile above the canopy, was 3--8 times greater than at the unvegetated site (0.01--0.023 vs. 2.9 × 10− 3).},

	Abstract = {Lake Analyzer is a numerical code coupled with supporting visualization tools for determining indices of mixing and stratification that are critical to the biogeochemical cycles of lakes and reservoirs. Stability indices, including Lake Number, Wedderburn Number, Schmidt Stability, and thermocline depth are calculated according to established literature definitions and returned to the user in a time series format. The program was created for the analysis of high-frequency data collected from instrumented lake buoys, in support of the emerging field of aquatic sensor network science. Available outputs for the Lake Analyzer program are: water temperature (error-checked and/or down-sampled), wind speed (error-checked and/or down-sampled), metalimnion extent (top and bottom), thermocline depth, friction velocity, Lake Number, Wedderburn Number, Schmidt Stability, mode-1 vertical seiche period, and Brunt-V{\"a}is{\"a}l{\"a} buoyancy frequency. Secondary outputs for several of these indices delineate the parent thermocline depth (seasonal thermocline) from the shallower secondary or diurnal thermocline. Lake Analyzer provides a program suite and best practices for the comparison of mixing and stratification indices in lakes across gradients of climate, hydro-physiography, and time, and enables a more detailed understanding of the resulting biogeochemical transformations at different spatial and temporal scales.},

@article{fonseca_influence_1982-1,
	Abstract = {A salt-water flume was used to describe the mechanics of current flow around an articial Zostera marina meadow. Shear velocity and roughness height were positively correlated with seagrass surface area, and were positively/negatively correlated with current velocity. Current velocity intrusion into the meadow before diminution and maximum reduction (both at the 2 cm height line) proceed by factors of 1·25 and 2·07 cm into the meadow per cm s−1 of current velocity, respectively.

Froude number was correlated with mean bending angle of the canopy as a whole. Maximum bending had occurred with Froude = 1, but most bending had taken place by Froude = 0·4, a velocity of 40--50 cm s−1 in this experiment.

The meadow edge is the most dynamic zone of a seagrass meadow in regard to current flow. Bending of the shoot canopy is a mechanism for re-direction of current flow and in-canopy reduction of current velocity. Meadow dimensions may be regulated by scouring processes in different hydraulic regimes. Shoot bending and subsequent in-meadow current velocity reduction are mechanisms that affect self-shading and photosynthetic capabilities as well as providing habitat stability.},

	Abstract = {Vertical mixing, driven by turbulence in the ocean, underpins many of the critical interactions that allow life on earth to flourish since vertical buoyancy flux maintains global overturning circulation and vertical nutrient fluxes are critical to primary production. Prediction of the ocean system is therefore dependent on accurate simulation of turbulent processes that, by their very nature, are chaotic. A growing evidence base exists that provides insight into these complex processes and permits investigation of turbulence relative to better determined, and therefore predictable, parameters. Here we examine three time series of the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy (ε) in ``stability space''. We reveal an ordered structure within the mean distribution of ε that compares well to a variety of proposed models of oceanic turbulence. The requirement for differing site-specific tuning and only partial success however raises questions over ``missing physics'' within such models and the validity of measurement techniques.},

Seagrass leaf litter is commonly found along shores all around the world. The Mediterranean Sea is not an exception, and along the sandy shore wide and thick deposits of leaf litter can be found. The deposition of these structures has not yet been studied, our aim is to clarify the depositional--erosive process of seagrass leaf litter on a Mediterranean beach. A video image system, consisting of a camera and a video camera, was used to investigate the dynamics of the deposition of seagrass litter on beaches. Time-exposure images proved useful in investigating the seagrass berm deposition over the monitored period by using the {EOF} analysis, while videos are used to describe every deposition and erosion cycle.

The deposition of seagrass berms occurred from late October to early April, while during the rest of the year, the beach was free of litter. The first deposition occurred in October, when seagrass litter was available on the submerged bay domain, the seagrass berm erosion occurred after several peaks of wind speed, while the deposition started when the wind speed increases and the waves start to break near to the shoreline. The deposition of the leaf litter on the beach starts as a strandline at the landward edge of the wave action and proceeds seaward up to the shoreline. Litter residue, eroded away by the waves and floating in the inner surf zone can be redeposited in little patches at the end of an erosion cycle. In conclusion, leaf litter may be relevant to berm formation and litter floating in the inner surf zone and in the lower swash zone is part of the materials exchanged between submerged and emerged beach.},

	Abstract = {In water supply reservoirs, selective withdrawal is commonly implemented to control released water temperature for quality purposes. This study investigated the effects of selective withdrawal on hydrodynamics of a stratified reservoir through numerical modeling and analytical analysis. A 3-D hydrodynamic model was applied where observations of water temperature time series recorded every 30 min at the thermocline and measured temperature profiles along the water column were used to validate the numerical model. The effect of selective withdrawal from four outlets located along the water intake structure of Tahtali Reservoir in Turkey on water temperatures was investigated and the effects on thermal stratification structure were discussed. Withdrawal of the water at the bottom outlet was found to be the most effective choice encouraging the mixing of the water column and thus reducing anoxia. The results of this study can be used to guide the further investigations in stratified lakes for better management practices.},

@article{fringer_unstructured-grid_2006,
	Abstract = {A finite-volume formulation is presented that solves the three-dimensional, nonhydrostatic Navier--Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation on an unstructured, staggered, z-level grid, with the goal of simulating nonhydrostatic processes in the coastal ocean with grid resolutions of tens of meters. In particular, the code has been developed to simulate the nonlinear, nonhydrostatic internal wave field in the littoral ocean. The method is based on the formulation developed by Casulli, in that the free-surface and vertical diffusion are semi-implicit, thereby removing stability limitations associated with the surface gravity wave and vertical diffusion terms. The remaining terms in the momentum equations are discretized explicitly with the second-order Adams--Bashforth method, while the pressure-correction method is employed for the nonhydrostatic pressure in order to achieve overall second-order temporal accuracy. Advection of momentum is accomplished with an Eulerian discretization which conserves momentum in cells that do not contain the free surface, and scalar advection is discretized in a way that ensures consistency with continuity, thereby ensuring local and global mass conservation using a velocity field that conserves volume on a local and global basis. The nonhydrostatic pressure field is solved efficiently using a block-Jacobi preconditioner, and while stability is limited by the internal gravity wave speed and vertical advection of momentum, applications requiring relatively small time steps due to accuracy or stability constraints are run efficiently on parallel computers, since the present formulation is written entirely with the message-passing interface ({MPI}). The {ParMETIS} libraries are employed in order to achieve a load-balanced parallel partitioning that minimizes interprocessor communication, and the grid is reordered to optimize per-processor performance by limiting cache misses while accessing arrays in memory. Test cases demonstrate the ability of the code to efficiently and accurately compute the nonhydrostatic lock exchange and internal waves in idealized as well as real domains, and we evaluate the parallel efficiency of the code using up to 32 processors.},

	Abstract = {Seagrass canopies influence water flow partly as a consequence of their morphology. Amphibolis antarctica (Labill.) Sonder et Aschers. ex Aschers, an Australian endemic, is different morphologically from more-commonly studied blade-like seagrasses such as Zostera and Thalassia. Field measurements and model predictions were used to characterize water flow within and above an A. antarctica meadow.

A series of high resolution three-dimensional velocity measurements were obtained within, above and adjacent to A. antarctica meadows at different heights above the seabed. Field observations on the effect of seagrass canopy on flow show an overall damping effect. Power spectra of the velocity data revealed a reduction in energy from 500 (cm s−1)2s−1to 10 (cm s−1)2s−1within the canopy. Profiles of kinetic energy were calculated from in situ velocity measurements at 5 cm increments from 10 cm to 80 cm above the seabed, within and above the seagrass canopy. There was an intensification of flow where the canopy structure was densest (approximately 40 cm above the seabed) and slightly above it. The baffling effect of the canopy was most effective 25 cm above the seabed: here the flow was reduced from 50 cm s−1at free surface to 2--5 cm s−1. A slight increase in flow within the canopy was seen 10 cm above the sediment due to reduced friction exerted by the lower leafless stems of the plants.

A high resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was coupled to a ten-layer canopy model for shallow coastal site dimensions. By applying different friction factors to various parts of the plant, mimicking its architecture, water flow was shown to be altered by the plant canopy according to its morphology. The derived computational results were in good agreement with the observed in situ velocity and kinetic energy changes. As a result of this study it is now possible to accurately predict plant--flow interactions determining pollen and particles distribution and dispersal.},

@article{geyer_influence_1997,
	Abstract = {Observations of two small estuaries in Cape Cod, U.S.A. indicate large variations in salinity structure that are forced by variations in along-estuary wind stress. During onshore winds, the estuarine circulation is reduced, and the along-estuary salinity gradient increases as freshwater accumulates. During offshore winds, the surface outflow is enhanced, freshwater is flushed out of the estuary, and the along-estuary salinity gradient becomes weak. Constrictions block the wind-induced flushing, resulting in strong salinity fronts across the constrictions. The residence time of one of the estuaries varies by more than a factor of three in response to variations in wind-induced flushing. The other estuary has little variation of flushing associated with winds, due to a constriction at the mouth that inhibits the wind-induced exchange. The strong influence of winds on the flushing of these estuaries is due in part to their shallow depths, which accentuates the influence of wind stress relative to the effects of the horizontal density gradient. In addition, the residence times of the estuaries are comparable to the time scale of wind forcing, allowing large changes in water properties during wind events.},

@article{holman_infragravity_1981,
	Abstract = {Field measurements of onshore and longshore velocities in the surf zone have been obtained on Martinique Beach, Nova Scotia, for the purpose of investigating the dynamics of the infragravity band (0.003--0.03 Hz) of the spectra. A total of 35 data runs were obtained during a 1-week period. Of particular interest is the response of the infragravity energy to the changing incident waves, which increased considerably in size during the latter half of the week due to an approaching hurricane. It is shown theoretically, using equilibrium arguments, that the infragravity amplitude should vary approximately linearly with incident wave amplitude. This is supported from the field data if significant wave height is used as a measure of incident amplitude. The incident band of spectra observed by instruments in the surf zone is limited by breaking. Thus the infragravity band appears to dominate these spectra during storms. The analysis is carried out in terms of a spectral transformation, the spectrum which would be observed at an offshore instrument if the shoreline amplitude spectrum were white with unit spectral energy density. For onshore velocity the transformation predicts the observed spectral structure in the infragravity band, showing that the structure did not represent any true frequency selection. The match of theory and data also implies that the onshore motions are free waves, forced near resonance. The longshore spectra are red and show no structure which would be associated with free waves. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction that many edge wave modes, including high modes, would be forced given the broad directional spread of the storm waves. It is noted that further field experiments would be simpler on the Pacific coast where the typical, narrow-band, incident swell should force only a few, low, edge wave modes, a more accommodating situation to observe and analyze.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}This contribution aims to model the dominant processes that control sedimentation within the ocean inlet to intermittently open-closed coastal lagoons; focussing on the role of infilling, backfilling and morphodynamic feedback. The key elements that have been included in the present model are: (1) the delivery of sediment to the mouth of the estuary by littoral processes; (2) sediment transport processes within the inlet due to non-linear tidal flow; and (3) the down-slope diffusion of sediment. The model discussed here includes a simple one-dimensional (1-D), non-linear flow parameterisation that predicts the spatial variability in the magnitude and non-linearity of the tidal flow. The predicted third and fourth velocity moments are used to drive a morphodynamic module. Down-slope diffusion of sediment is dealt with in a separate diffusion term in the bed-evolution equation. Feedback between the evolving morphology and the flow field are integral to the model. Numerical simulations are used to investigate different modes of evolution for this type of inlet system. Inlet closure due to infilling is critically controlled by the balance between sediment addition at the mouth due to littoral processes and the removal of sediment by non-linear tidal flow. Rapid widening or deepening of the inlet at its landward margin leads to the deposition of a flood shoal. Under conditions of high sedimentation (and low diffusion) the flood shoal can become sufficiently well developed to present a physical barrier to sediment entering the lagoon. Under these circumstances backfilling can become significant. The infilling and backfilling processes are ameliorated by efficient down-slope diffusion which is controlled in the present model by a diffusion parameter, D. High diffusion coefficients slow inlet closure and allow sediment to propagate further into the lagoon.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {The effects of water level variations on breaking wave setup over fringing reefs are assessed using field measurements obtained at three study sites in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Mariana Islands in the western tropical Pacific Ocean. At each site, reef flat setup varies over the tidal range with weaker setup at high tide and stronger setup at low tide for a given incident wave height. The observed water level dependence is interpreted in the context of radiation stress gradients specified by an idealized point break model generalized for nonnormally incident waves. The tidally varying setup is due in part to depth-limited wave heights on the reef flat, as anticipated from previous reef studies, but also to tidally dependent breaking on the reef face. The tidal dependence of the breaking is interpreted in the context of the point break model in terms of a tidally varying wave height to water depth ratio at breaking. Implications for predictions of wave-driven setup at reef-fringed island shorelines are discussed.},

	Abstract = {A coupled wave-circulation numerical model of Hanalei Bay, Hawaii, was constructed to investigate controls on nearshore hydrodynamics and overall circulation of a bathymetrically-complex coral reef embayment that is exposed to large waves and river floods several times per annum. The model was calibrated using in situ data representative of the two conditions that dominate the region's wave climate: one associated with local trade winds and associated trade-wind waves, and the other with distant-source episodic large swells. The model results were improved by including spatially-varying hydrodynamic bed roughness and making the semi-empirical wave-breaking parameter dependent on incident wave steepness and reef slope. During trade-wind conditions, circulation was primarily wind-driven and volume flux-based flushing times of the bay were on the order of 35 h. Under the episodic swell conditions, circulation were dominated by wave-driven flows and flushing times decreased to as little as 2 h. The vigorous hydrodynamics that occur during the upper 10\% most energetic swell conditions indicate that only a few (0--10) events each year are likely capable of exporting significant volumes of sediment from the bay. Like many fringing reef areas backed by steep-sided watersheds on tropical and sub-tropical high islands worldwide, Hanalei Bay receives high episodic fluvial sediment load during a similarly low number of flood events. These similarly episodic but decoupled processes of sediment delivery and removal identified here suggest that the water quality and sedimentary environment of Hanalei Bay and similar linked watershed-reef systems are sensitive to changes in annual storm frequency and intensity.},

@article{friedrichs_nonlinear_1992,
	Abstract = {The dynamics of many shallow tidal embayments may be usefully represented by a single ``zero-inertia'' equation for tidal elevation which has the form of a nonlinear diffusion equation. The zero-inertia equation clarifies the lowest order dynamics, namely, a balance between pressure gradient and friction. It also provides insight into the properties of higher-order harmonic components via the identification of compact approximate solutions and governing nondimensional parameters. Approximate analytic solutions which assume a constant diffusion coefficient are governed by the nondimensional parameters x/L and ‖k0‖L, where L is the length of the embayment, and ‖k0‖−1 scales both the length of factional dissipation and the physical length of the diffusive waveform. As ‖k0‖L increases, the speed at which the tidal signal diffuses decreases, and the rate of decay of tidal amplitude with distance increases. The parameter ‖k0‖L increases as depth is reduced, friction is increased, forcing amplitude or frequency is increased, or total embayment width is increased relative to the width of the channel. Approximate analytic solutions which assume a time-varying diffusion coefficient result in additional components at the zeroth, second, and third harmonic frequencies. The zeroth and second harmonics are governed by the parameter γ, as well as x/L and ‖k0‖L. Parameter γ measures the relative importance of time variations of channel depth (γ{\textgreater} 0) versus time variations in embayment width (γ{\textless} 0). If γ {\textgreater} 0, the diffusion coefficient is larger near the crest of the tidal waveform, causing the rising tide to be of shorter duration and mean elevation to be set up. If γ{\textless} 0, the diffusion coefficient is larger near the trough, causing the falling tide to be shorter and elevation to be set down. The third harmonic is produced by fluctuations in the diffusion coefficient associated with times of greatest surface gradient. The third harmonic is governed only by the parameters x/L and ‖k0‖L, which indicates the third harmonic is insensitive to time variations in cross-sectional geometry. Comparisons to field observations and to numerical solutions of the full equations including inertia terms indicate that the zero-inertia equation (1) reproduces the results of the more general one-dimensional equations to within the accuracy predicted by scaling arguments and (2) reproduces the main features of the nonlinear tidal signal observed in many shallow tidal embayments.},

	Abstract = {Abstract 
Bar-built estuaries with relatively small (cross sectional area \&lt; 100 m2) and shallow tidal inlets are widespread in Mediterranean climates and along wave-exposed coasts. While similarly important to coastal sediment balances and estuarine ecosystems and more numerous than larger inlet systems, they suffer from a relative lack of understanding. This is especially true regarding the process of inlet closure, when the channel is filled with sediment deposited by wave-driven processes. Mouth closure is of growing concern owing to changes in inlet behavior in many systems in response to human influences. The use of many existing conceptual and quantitative models for closure is precluded by rapid morphological change, unsteady freshwater inputs, and difficulties in scaling well-established inlet relationships in these smaller systems. In this paper, over 60 years of daily closure records are analyzed for the Russian River mouth, a prototypical bar-built system in northern California. We show that the time-dependent closure pattern can be explained by an interaction of processes that act to scour the inlet (driven by tides and river) with those that act to deposit sand in the inlet (driven by waves). Tidal, weather-related, seasonal, and interannual cycles are observed. We improve an existing parametric model to evaluate these separate influences and show that it works well for predicting closure events at both the tidal and seasonal scales. Finally, we compare our data with closure records from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to show that inlet closures have become shorter and more sporadic over time at this site and to identify anthropogenic drivers of this observed change.},

	Abstract = {The offshore tide becomes strongly distorted as it propagates into shallow estuarine systems. Observations of sea surface elevation and horizontal currents over periods ranging from three days to one year, at nine stations within Nauset inlet/estuary, document the non-linear interaction of the off-shore equilibrium tidal constituents. Despite strong frictional attenuation within the estuary, the overtides and compound tides of M2, S2 and N2, in particular, reach significant amplitude, resulting in strong tidal distortion. High frequency forced constituents in sea surface are phase-locked, consistently leading the forcing tides by 60-70$\,^{\circ}$, resulting in a persistent distortion where falling tide is longer than rising tide. Forced constituents in currents are more nearly in phase with equilibrium constituents, producing flood currents which are shorter but more intense than ebb currents. A compound fortnightly tide, {MSf}, modulates the mean water level such that lowest tides occur during neap phase instead of spring phase. This fortnightly tide can be contaminated by storm surge, changing the phase characteristics of this constituent. Implications of the overtides, compound tides, and lower frequency tides on near-bed, suspended and dissolved material transport are profound.},

@article{green_processes_2001,
	Abstract = {Detailed measurements of waves, currents and sediment transport from an intertidal sandflat at the mouth of a partially filled New Zealand estuary in an embayment with low littoral drift are presented with a view to establishing how marine sands are transported into the estuary. Waves mobilised sediments during episodic events. Early in events, when waves were energetic, sediments were in motion throughout the tidal cycle. Under abating waves, sediment motion became intermittent, finally becoming restricted to periods around low tide, when wave-orbital motions were able to penetrate to the bed. Three components of the total sediment flux were estimated from the data and analysed. (1) A wind-driven current, which presumably has a complicated spatial expression in the vicinity of the estuary mouth, controlled the net (i.e. integrated over event) direction of flux of suspended sediment entrained by waves and advected by currents. There was no evidence of non-symmetry over the tidal cycle in the suspension process that might drive a net sediment flux; however, there is some suggestion that lag in growth and decay of the estuary wave field over the tidal cycle systematically enhances offshore transport. (2) Net bedload transport by waves and currents was directed onshore, which was guaranteed by two mechanisms. Firstly, increasing wave-orbital-current skewness as the tide ebbed turned bedload transport onshore late in the ebb tide against the current and, secondly, bedload peaked early in the flood tide when skewed waves were reinforced by the flooding current. (3) Correlation between seaward-directed forced mean flow and enhanced suspension under groups of high waves resulted in persistent offshore flux of suspended sediment at infragravity frequencies. Suspended-sediment flux carried by gravity waves was directed seawards on flood tides (and counter to the waves) and onshore on ebb tides (and with the waves), which was explained in terms of a simple vortex-ejection model. We conclude that sediment transport on the sandflat at the mouth of this partially filled estuary is governed by subtle interactions between waves and currents that vary over the tidal cycle. Some interactions, such as those that drive bedload transport, promote estuary infilling by marine sands, and others, such as those that drive suspended-sediment flux at infragravity frequencies, do the opposite.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we derive the potential energy anomaly equation suitable for the analysis of three-dimensional numerical models. We apply this equation to the results of an idealised numerical model simulation of the Rhine River Plume and demonstrate how we can use the potential energy anomaly equation to analyse the physical processes affecting stratification, in this region of freshwater influence ({ROFI}). For this test case, we use the 10 terms from the potential energy anomaly equation that dominate the evolution of stratification in the Rhine {ROFI}. The principal terms are the cross-shore and along-shore straining and cross-shore and along-shore advection of horizontal density gradients. In addition non-linear shear dispersion terms representing correlations between density and velocity perturbations over the vertical control horizontal exchange and mixing in the cross-shore and along-shore directions. Moreover, in the vertical direction two terms dominate the vertical exchange processes: a term describing the effect of vertical mixing on the density profile, and a term related to up and downwelling. Analysis of the model results using the potential energy anomaly equation allows us to present a detailed overview of the spatial distribution of the terms affecting the evolution of stratification in the Rhine {ROFI}. The results highlight the important role of cross-shore tidal straining in the downstream coastal current region of the plume. In addition, the roles of along-shore straining, as well as along-shore and cross-shore advection in the Rhine {ROFI}, in particular in the region of the bulge near the river mouth, are also of importance. The results for the Rhine {ROFI} show that the potential energy anomaly equation provides a powerful tool with which to analyse the mechanisms contributing to mixing and stratification in coastal seas and estuaries.},

The experiments show that shear waves generated when the outflow is begun are identical to those generated when the outflow is stopped. The amplitudes of the lowest mode shear waves can be calculated by assuming that they combine to form the steady withdrawal‐layer velocity profile at the wall. As R, the parameter governing steady withdrawal behavior, is increased, the observed shear‐wave amplitudes decrease relative to their theoretical values, with, the discrepancy increasing with increasing mode number. When the outflow is repeatedly pulsed, the strength of the average flow towards the sink indicates the existance of a withdrawal layer thicker than that which would have been formed given either the average flow rate or the maximum instantaneous flow rate. This observation suggests that one effect of unsteady withdrawals may be to create thicker withdrawal layers than are found for similar steady withdrawals.},

	Abstract = {Physical processes at tidal inlets that require an understanding beyond the state-of-the-art for improving the technology to maintain navigable channels are prioritized within a framework determined by the need to minimize impacts to the adjacent shores and the interior environment. In this regard, sandy inlets relevant to the majority of federal navigation projects are given special consideration. Since historic, good quality data on the physical processes and their interactions with structures are available for several sandy inlets, documentation and analysis of these data are strongly recommended as a precursor to plans for collection of additional field data. In addition, experiments of opportunity can be carried out at inlets that collectively encompass wide ranging characteristics of relevant physical processes. Beyond these case studies, dedicated field investigations, laboratory studies and mathematical modeling will be essential for understanding and simulating flow and sediment transport in the complex, episodically driven environment seaward of the inlet channel, and the role of structures in modulating these processes. In many cases, numerical modeling is evidently a powerful tool for simulating and predicting inlet hydrodynamics, sediment transport, bottom evolution and the effects of structures. However, the need to carry out design and impact studies using meager data bases, and time and cost constraints, has led to the widespread and successful use of analytic approaches, despite their evident limitations. Such approaches are most useful in providing a basic understanding of the physical processes and interactions, and will continue to be used in inlet engineering practice.},

@article{cahoon_review_2006,
	Abstract = {Storms have long been recognized as agents of geomorphic change to coastal wetlands. A review of recent data on soil elevation dynamics before and after storms revealed that storms affected wetland elevations by storm surge, high winds, and freshwater flushing of the estuary (inferred). The data also indicate that measures of sediment deposition and erosion can often misrepresent the amount and even direction of elevation change because of storm influences on subsurface processes. Simultaneous influence on both surface and subsurface processe by storms means that soil elevation cannot always be accurately estimated from surface process data alone. Eight processes are identified as potentially influencing soil elevation: sediment deposition, sediment erosion, sediment compaction, soil shrinkage, root decomposition (following tree mortality from high winds), root growth (following flushing with freshwater, inferred), soil swelling, and lateral folding of the marsh root mat. Local wetland condition (e.g., marsh health, tide height, groundwater level) and the physical characteristics of the storm (e.g., angle of approach, proximity, amount of rain, wind speed, and storm surge height) were apparently important factors determining the storm's effect on soil elevation. Storm effect on elevation were both permanent (on an ecological time scale) and short-lived, but event short-term changes have potentially important ecological consequences. Shallow soil subsidence or expansion caused by a storm must be considered when calculating local rates of relative sea level rise and evaluating storm effects on wetland stability.},

@article{geyer_quantifying_2008-1,
	Abstract = {Estuarine turbulence is notable in that both the dissipation rate and   the buoyancy frequency extend to much higher values than in other   natural environments. The high dissipation rates lead to a distinct   inertial subrange in the velocity and scalar spectra, which can be   exploited for quantifying the turbulence quantities. However, high   buoyancy frequencies lead to small Ozmidov scales, which require high   sampling rates and small spatial aperture to resolve the turbulent   fluxes. A set of observations in a highly stratified estuary demonstrate   the effectiveness of a vessel-mounted turbulence array for resolving   turbulent processes, and for relating the turbulence to the forcing by   the Reynolds-averaged flow. The observations focus on the ebb, when most   of the buoyancy flux occurs. Three stages of mixing are observed: (1)   intermittent and localized but intense shear instability during the   early ebb; (2) continuous and relatively homogeneous shear-induced   mixing during the mid-ebb, and weakly stratified, boundary-layer mixing   during the late ebb. The mixing efficiency as quantified by the flux   Richardson number Rf was frequently observed to be higher than the   canonical value of 0.15 from Osborn (J Phys Oceanogr 10:83-89, 1980).   The high efficiency may be linked to the temporal-spatial evolution of   shear instabilities.},

	Abstract = {A limitation in predictive capability in South Africa is the lack of predictive tools to simulate hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes in small stratified or partially stratified estuaries. Investigations on the applicability of available three-dimensional (3D) numerical models, in this case Ihe {DELFT}3D-{FLOW} model, were undertaken using the Kromme and Palmiet estuaries as case studies. Of particular importance in these small stratified or partially stratified systems is the accurate simulation of the vertical mixing and entrainment processes as these are important determinants of the flushing rates and water quality in these estuaries. In both of the above case studies, the 3D model simulations accurately reproduced the major features of these stratified systems for a month or more, particularly the flushing rates. However, the significant computational effort required for 3D models typically restricts the simulations to monthly (i.e. event scales) or seasonal time scales. This paper concludes that a predictive capability, based on 3D hydrodynamic models, can be implemented for small stratified and partially stratified estuaries. The planned implementation of a similar 3D water quality model will further enhance the capability to predict the consequences of estuarine management strategies in such estuaries.},

	Abstract = {The Arctic climate is changing. Permafrost is warming, hydrological processes are changing and biological and social systems are also evolving in response to these changing conditions. Knowing how the structure and function of arctic terrestrial ecosystems are responding to recent and persistent climate change is paramount to understanding the future state of the Earth system and how humans will need to adapt. Our holistic review presents a broad array of evidence that illustrates convincingly; the Arctic is undergoing a system-wide response to an altered climatic state. New extreme and seasonal surface climatic conditions are being experienced, a range of biophysical states and processes influenced by the threshold and phase change of freezing point are being altered, hydrological and biogeochemical cycles are shifting, and more regularly human sub-systems are being affected. Importantly, the patterns, magnitude and mechanisms of change have sometimes been unpredictable or difficult to isolate due to compounding factors. In almost every discipline represented, we show how the biocomplexity of the Arctic system has highlighted and challenged a paucity of integrated scientific knowledge, the lack of sustained observational and experimental time series, and the technical and logistic constraints of researching the Arctic environment. This study supports ongoing efforts to strengthen the interdisciplinarity of arctic system science and improve the coupling of large scale experimental manipulation with sustained time series observations by incorporating and integrating novel technologies, remote sensing and modeling.},

	Abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: Fine-scale spatial effects of a seagrass meadow on suspended particle transport were assessed from current speeds, orbital wave velocities, turbulent Reynolds stress, in situ particle concentrations, and sedimentation rates for a horizontal grid in a coastal seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) meadow at 2 depths and during low- and high-energy periods. For the low-energy period, the vertical reduction of the total kinetic energy, from 100 cm to {\textasciitilde} 10 cm above the bottom, was large in the meadow (up to 95\%) than over the sand (35 to 75\%). Velocity maps suggest that a recirculating flow formed in the meadow with a higher Reynolds stress at the edge of the meadow. Near the bed, concentrations of small particles ({\textless}10 µm diameter) were lower inside the meadow than over barren sand, while concentrations of large particles ({\textgreater}10 µm) were lower over the barren sand. For the period of stronger current and wave activity following a storm, nearbed turbulence and orbital wave velocity were elevated, though still lower inside the meadow than over the sand. For this high energy period, particle concentrations increased over the whole study area, but were still lowest deep inside the meadow. Overall, the horizontal spatial distribution of plants in the study area had a profound effect on the flow field and on vertical transport, even during the high-energy period. The reduced nearbed turbulence and lower sedimentation rate below the canopy confirms it as a calm zone with lower mixing compared to unvegetated areas. Erratum},

Through the reproduction of experimental flume tests and grid dependency tests, this method has shown its numerical coherence as well as its ability to simulate accurately both momentum and turbulent turbine-induced perturbations in both near and far wakes in a relatively short period of computation time.

They vary in size and shape in relation to antecedent morphology, the form of the enclosing barrier, and the extent of erosion and deposition since their initial formation. There are variations related to geological, hydrological, climatic and ecological factors. Some have been shallowed by sedimentation; others have shrunk as the result of bordering accretion, including swamp land encroachment; others have become rounded, and in some cases segmented by the growth and coalescence of cuspate spits. Salinity regimes, related primarily to the interaction of fresh water from rain and rivers with salt water from the sea, related to the dimensions and variability of marine entrances, condition their ecology, and determine the extent of mangroves, salt marsh and transitions to freshwater vegetation, which in turn influence swamp development and encroachment. Examples are given of lagoon dynamics related to each of these factors, and to recent man-induced changes.},

@article{mccreary_dynamics_1987,
	Abstract = {The dynamics of the California Current system are studied using two ocean models, one with a shelf and one without. Both models are viscid and linearized about a background density field Pb(Z), Solutions are forced by steady and annually periodic winds with and without curl, and by an idealization of the observed wind field off California.Solutions forced by a steady, equatorward, curl-free wind τy all have an equatorward surface coastal jet and a poleward undercurrent. Due to the β-effect and horizontal mixing, the circulation is not necessarily confined within a Rossby radius of the coast. The strength and structure of the currents vary considerably with parameters, the currents being stronger and broader when the forcing includes remote winds to the south and when ρb has a near-surface pycnocline. If τy oscillates at the annual cycle the response is qualitatively quasi-steady, but it also involves a poleward, offshore and vertical propagation of waves, and the maximum coastal current leads τy by several weeks.Solutions forced by a steady, positive wind curl τyx develop a deep, broad, poleward surface current near the coast, consistent with Sverdrup theory. Interestingly, there is also an equatorward surface flow located farther offshore, which exists because of the vertical mixing in the model. Solutions are not very dependent on model parameters, because they are primarily interior currents directly in balance with the wind curl and do not require the coast for their existence. If τyx oscillates at the annual cycle, the response is not at all quasi-steady, and the maximum coastal current lags τyx by 1-2 months.Solutions forced by an idealization of the observed wind field off California compare favorably with observations, but only if Pb has a realistic pycnocline and the forcing includes remote winds off Baja California. Forcing by positive τyx accounts for both the poleward Davidson Current during the winter and the equatorward flow located more than 100 km offshore throughout the year. The coastal jet forced by τy provides summertime equatorward flow within 100 km of the coast that is strong enough to reverse the poleward flow driven by τyx.},

@article{beach_suspended_1988,
	Abstract = {A field experiment to investigate the magnitude and temporal and spatial scales of suspended sediment transport in the inner surf zone was conducted at San Marine, Oregon on October 7--13, 1984. Instrumentation consisted of five electromagnetic current meters, three strain gauge-type pressure transducers, and 25 optical backscatter sensors to measure the concentrations of suspended sediment. The instruments were deployed approximately 70 m (x) seaward of the mean high water line (mean depth h̄ = 1.1−1.3 m) in a closely spaced cross-shaped pattern. Data were collected for 68 min periods spanning high tide during the 7 day experiment.

During the experiment, waves varied in angle of approach from shore-normal to southwesterly. Offshore significant swell heights were 3--5 m with periods of 12--14 s. Local sea conditions with wind waves of approximately 8 s also occurred. A visual estimation of the width of the surf zone indicated it to be approximately 500 m and the breaker pattern suggested that there were two longshore bars at approximately 200 and 500 m offshore. The data resulting from the experiment encompass a broad range of wave and current conditions which included periods of extreme infragravity motion (30 \&lt; T \&lt; 300 s) and weak longshore currents, and periods of low infragravity motion and strong longshore currents. Periods of incident wave dominance also occurred.

The field study section of this paper qualitatively describes the sediment response to strong ($\pm$ 240 cm s−1), low-frequency (0.01 Hz), cross-shore fluid motions which dominated the inner surf zone during two of the data runs. The infragravity band accounted for 85\% of the cross-shore velocity variance, the peak (0.01 Hz) of which was associated with shore-normal standing waves. Concentration gradients of suspended sediment appear to be associated with diffusive processes and develop and decay on time scales of the infragravity motions rather than those of incident waves. Suspension events during times of infragravity dominance often persisted for periods of 30--45 s and reached peak concentrations of 20--40 g l−1 at elevations in excess of 26 cm. Mean suspended load was 3--4 times larger than that associated with incident wave motions.

The modeling section of the paper attempts to quantitatively describe the observed time-dependent, vertical suspended sediment distribution with a one-dimensional, turbulent diffusion model. Formulations of eddy diffusion and erosion rate coefficients associated with peak cross-shore flows are found to agree with or fall within the range of values from previous laboratory and field studies and are used in the model. The model is evaluated by its ability to reproduce the time-dependent vertical distribution of suspended sediment and to estimate the observed mean suspended load, and the correct direction and magnitude of the mean longshore and cross-shore flux (level above the bed z = 31 cm) of suspended sediment.},

@article{rosenzweig_population_1969,
	Abstract = {We investigated the relative densities of granivorous, nocturnal desert rodents in small plots within two arid regions of Arizona to study how sympatric species avoid competitive extinction. The most common rodents were kangaroo rats, Dipodomys spp., and pocket mice, Perognathus spp. We attempted correlating the density of each species with several environmental measurements, derived from the soil's i) depth; ii) texture or iii) resistance to sheer stress; or from the plant's i) species diversity; ii) growth forms or iii) foliage density. Successful variables were derived from plant growth form and foliage density. The soil's resistance to sheer stress also seemed important for a few species. In general, kangaroo rats were associated with sparseness of vegetation; pocket mice with denseness. One group of mice, which we term bush mice, seemed to require bushes and included two Perognathus spp., three Peromyscus spp., and probably a harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens). Two other Perognathus spp. were taken in grassy habitats. Some suitable habitats tended to be complementary to others, suggesting that species associated with them are competitors. Comparisons of the density and distribution of D. merriami, present in both regions but under different biotic circumstances, reinforces the opinion that competition is responsible for the complementariness of habitats. In some cases the evidence suggests that competitive coexistence is accounted for by the fact that different specializations are needed to escape predation in different environments. We use variables which correlate with the relative density of various species to construct a model of habitat complexity. The rodent species diversities obtained in our plots can be approximately accounted for by this model. The model is based on the premises that the rodents collectively discriminate four qualities of soil surface, and three heights and two densities of vegetation. In general, specializations based on biotic variables appear most important.},

	Abstract = {A hydrologic monitoring program was implemented in a nest of watersheds within the Kuparuk River basin in northern Alaska as part of an interdisciplinary effort to quantify the flux of mass and energy from a large arctic area. Described here are characteristics of annual hydrographs and individual storm hydrographs of four basins draining areas of 0.026 km2, 2.2 km2, 142 km2, and 8140 km2; an assessment of the influence that permafrost has on those characteristics; and comparisons to rivers in regions without permafrost. Snowmelt runoff dominated the annual runoff in each basin. A typical storm hydrograph in the Kuparuk River basin had a fast initial response time, long time lags between the hyetograph and hydrograph centroids, an extended recession, and a high runoff/precipitation ratio due to the diminished storage caused by permafrost. The seemingly contradictory results of fast response times and extended recessions can be explained by the presence of a large saturated area occupied by hillslope water tracks. This saturated area provides a partial-source area for fast runoff generation that bypasses the storage capacity of organic soils and tundra vegetation.},

@article{lacy_influence_2011-1,
	Abstract = {The influence of eelgrass (Zostera marina) on near-bed currents, turbulence, and drag was investigated at three sites in two eelgrass canopies of differing density and at one unvegetated site in the San Juan archipelago of Puget Sound, Washington, {USA}. Eelgrass blade length exceeded 1 m. Velocity profiles up to 1.5 m above the sea floor were collected over a spring-neap tidal cycle with a downward-looking pulse-coherent acoustic Doppler profiler above the canopies and two acoustic Doppler velocimeters within the canopies. The eelgrass attenuated currents by a minimum of 40\%, and by more than 70\% at the most densely vegetated site. Attenuation decreased with increasing current speed. The data were compared to the shear-layer model of vegetated flows and the displaced logarithmic model. Velocity profiles outside the meadows were logarithmic. Within the canopies, most profiles were consistent with the shear-layer model, with a logarithmic layer above the canopy. However, at the less-dense sites, when currents were strong, shear at the sea floor and above the canopy was significant relative to shear at the top of the canopy, and the velocity profiles more closely resembled those in a rough-wall boundary layer. Turbulence was strong at the canopy top and decreased with height. Friction velocity at the canopy top was 1.5--2 times greater than at the unvegetated, sandy site. The coefficient of drag {CD} on the overlying flow derived from the logarithmic velocity profile above the canopy, was 3--8 times greater than at the unvegetated site (0.01--0.023 vs. 2.9 × 10− 3).},

@article{valle-levinson_spatial_2007,
	Abstract = {Underway current velocity profiles were combined with temperature and salinity profiles at fixed stations to describe tidal and subtidal flow patterns in the middle of the northernmost Chilean fjord, Estuario Reloncav{\'\i}. This is the first study involving current velocity measurements in this fjord. Reloncav{\'\i} fjord is 55 km long, 2 km wide, and on average is 170 m deep. Measurements concentrated around a marked bend of the coastline, where an 8-km along-fjord transect was sampled during a semidiurnal tidal cycle in March 2002 and a 2-km cross-fjord transect was occupied, also during a semidiurnal cycle, in May 2004. The fjord hydrography showed a relatively thin (\&lt;5 m deep), continuously stratified, buoyant layer with stratification values \&gt;4 kg m −3 per meter of depth. Below this thin layer, the water was relatively homogeneous. Semidiurnal tidal currents had low amplitudes (\&lt;10 cm s −1 ) that allowed the persistence of a surface front throughout the tidal cycle. The front oscillated with a period of ca. 2.5 h and showed excursions of 2 km. The front oscillations could have been produced by a lateral seiche that corresponds to the natural period of oscillation across the fjord. This front could have also caused large (2 h) phase lags in the semidiurnal tidal currents, from one end of the transect to the other, within the buoyant layer. Tidal phases were relatively uniform underneath this buoyant layer. Subtidal flows showed a 3-layer pattern consisting of a surface layer (8 m thick, of 5 cm s −1 surface outflow), an intermediate layer (70 m thick, of 3 cm s −1 net inflow), and a bottom layer (below 80 m depth, of 3 cm s −1 net outflow). The surface outflow and, to a certain extent, the inflow layer were related to the buoyant water interacting with the ambient oceanic water. The inflowing layer and the bottom outflow were attributed to nonlinear effects associated with a tidal wave that reflects at the fjord's head. The weak subtidal currents followed the morphology of the bend and caused downwelling on the inside and upwelling on the outside part of the bend.},

@article{mcclelland_arctic_2012,
	Abstract = {Large freshwater contributions to the Arctic Ocean from a variety of sources combine in what is, by global standards, a remarkably small ocean basin. Indeed, the Arctic Ocean receives ∼11\% of global river discharge while accounting for only ∼1\% of global ocean volume. As a consequence, estuarine gradients are a defining feature not only near-shore, but throughout the Arctic Ocean. Sea-ice dynamics also play a pivotal role in the salinity regime, adding salt to the underlying water during ice formation and releasing fresh water during ice thaw. Our understanding of physical--chemical--biological interactions within this complex system is rapidly advancing. However, much of the estuarine research to date has focused on summer, open water conditions. Furthermore, our current conceptual model for Arctic estuaries is primarily based on studies of a few major river inflows. Future advancement of estuarine research in the Arctic requires concerted seasonal coverage as well as a commitment to working within a broader range of systems. With clear signals of climate change occurring in the Arctic and greater changes anticipated in the future, there is good reason to accelerate estuarine research efforts in the region. In particular, elucidating estuarine dynamics across the near-shore to ocean-wide domains is vital for understanding potential climate impacts on local ecosystems as well as broader climate feedbacks associated with storage and release of fresh water and carbon.},

@article{tung_morphological_2009,
	Abstract = {Inlet migration and closure usually occur in micro-tidal, wave-dominated coastal environments with strong seasonal variations in river flow and wave climate. In the last decades, efforts have been undertaken to identify, classify and quantify these phenomena using conceptual models, empirical relationships and behavior-based models. However, to obtain further insight into the dominant physics requires the application of a process-based model. This study investigates the migration and closure of an idealized tidal inlet system due to wave driven longshore sediment transport. The process-based morphodynamic modeling system Delft3D is applied for this purpose. The ratio of wave energy over tidal prism was changed systematically, through varying the tidal amplitude, tidal basin area and wave characteristics, to investigate the morphological response of the inlet (e.g. closure and migration). The results were compared with Bruun's empirical criteria for overall stability and with Escoffier stability concept. The results clearly indicate that a process-based model is able to reproduce a morphological inlet response consistent with Bruun's criteria and Escoffier's closure curve. A typical example of a migrating tidal inlet due to oblique waves is presented which includes features such as ebb channel formation, migration and welding to the downdrift barrier, and bypassing of ebb shoals. In other cases, inlet closure due to prolongation of the inlet channel and infilling with littoral-drift material is also reproduced.},

	Abstract = {Field observations of swash and ocean waves show that runup saturation at infragravity frequencies ({\textless}0.05 Hz) can occur under mild offshore energy conditions if the beach slope is sufficiently gentle. Infragravity saturation was observed for higher-frequency ({\textgreater}0.025--0.035 Hz) infragravity waves, where typically less than 5\% of the (linear) energy flux was reflected from the beach and where, similar to the sea swell band, the swash energy was independent of offshore wave energy. The infragravity frequency range of saturation was determined by the tide, with saturation extending to lower frequencies at low tide when the local beach face slope over the concave-shaped profile was gentler. Runup was strongly dominated by infragravity frequencies, which accounted on average for 96\% of the runup variance, and its energy levels were entirely consistent with strong infragravity wave dissipation observed in the surfzone, particularly when including the nonlinear contributions to the wave energy fluxes. The infragravity wave dissipation was strongly associated with breaking of sea swell waves, which abruptly decreased nonlinear transfers to infragravity frequencies and made infragravity dissipation prevail over forcing within the breaking region. Our observations show evidence of nonlinear interactions involving infragravity and high-frequency, harmonic waves and suggest that these harmonics could play a role in the wave energy balance near the shoreline on low-sloping, dissipative beaches.},

Here we quantified sediment transport in the Everglades by progressively increasing flow velocity in a field flume constructed around undisturbed bed sediment and emergent macrophytes. Suspended sediment \&lt; 100 μm was dominant in the lower range of laminar flow and was supplied by detachment from epiphyton. Sediment flux increased by a factor of four and coarse flocculent sediment \&gt; 100 μm became dominant at higher velocity steps after a threshold shear stress for bed floc entrainment was exceeded. Shedding of vortices that had formed downstream of plant stems also occurred on that velocity step which promoted additional sediment detachment from epiphyton. Modeling determined that the potentially entrainable sediment reservoir, 46 g m− 2, was similar to the reservoir of epiphyton (66 g m− 2) but smaller than the reservoir of flocculent bed sediment (330 g m− 2). All suspended sediment was enriched in phosphorus (by approximately twenty times) compared with bulk sediment on the bed surface and on plant stems, indicating that the most easily entrainable sediment is also the most nutrient rich (and likely the most biologically active).},

	Abstract = {Barnegat Bay, Manahawkin Bay, and Little Egg Harbor comprise a shallow, lagoon-type estuary along the central New Jersey coastline. With a surface area of 279 km² and an average depth of less than 2 m, the estuary forms an irregular tidal basin that extends north-south for nearly 70 km. The elongated embayment is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a narrow barrier island complex (i.e., Island Beach and Long Beach Island) which is breached at Barnegat Inlet ∼35 km south of Point Pleasant and at Little Egg Inlet near the southern margin. Saline waters enter through these two inlets as well as through the Point Pleasant Canal at the northern perimeter. Winds, tides, salinity gradients, inlet size and configuration, and the geomorphology of the estuary strongly control water circulation in the system. The shallowness of the open bay waters, the extensive shoals and marsh islands near the inlets, and the configuration of the perimeter areas restrict tidal flow and attenuate tidal energy in the embayment. The Barnegat Bay---Little Egg Harbor estuary and watershed are characterized by a wide range of habitats, including vegetated and unvegetated subtidal bay bottoms, intertidal flats and bay islands, dunes and beaches, tidal and freshwater marshes, upland and wetland forests, and other natural and altered areas. Bottom sediments in the estuary, consisting of a mosaic of sand, silt, clay, shells, and organic matter, support rich and diverse biotic communities. The watershed, encompassing an area of ∼1,730 km², likewise harbors numerous assemblages of organisms. More than 100 endangered, threatened, or rare species of plants and animals have been chronicled in the watershed. Many of these species continue to be affected by water quality degradation, the loss and alteration of habitat areas, and overuse or misuse of natural resources due to a burgeoning coastal human population.},

@article{rich_hydrologic_2013,
	Abstract = {Abstract
To better understand how the hydrology of bar-built estuaries affects breaching and closing patterns, a model is developed that incorporates an estuary hydrologic budget with a geomorphic model of the inlet system. Erosion of the inlet is caused by inlet flow, whereas the only morphologic effect of waves is the deposition of sand into the inlet. When calibrated, the model is able to reproduce the initial seasonal breaching, seasonal closure, intermittent closures and breaches, and the low-streamflow (closed state) estuary hydrology of the Carmel Lagoon, located in Central California. Model performance was tested against three separate years of water-level observations. When open during these years, the inlet was visually observed to drain directly across the beach berm, in accordance with model assumptions. The calibrated model predicts the observed 48-h estuary stage amplitude with root mean square errors of 0.45 m, 0.39 m and 0.42 m for the three separate years. For the calibrated model, the probability that the estuary inlet is closed decreases exponentially with increasing inflow (streamflow plus wave overtopping), decreasing 10-fold in probability as mean daily inflow increases from 0.2 to 1.0 m3/s. Seasonal patterns of inlet state reflect the seasonal pattern of streamflow, though wave overtopping may become the main hydrologic flux during low streamflow conditions, infrequently causing short-lived breaches. In a series of sensitivity analyses it is seen that the status of the inlet and storage of water are sensitive to factors that control the storage, transmission, and inflow of water. By varying individual components of the berm system and estuary storage, the amount of the time the estuary is open may increase by 57\%, or decrease by 44\%, compared to the amount of time the estuary is open during calibrated model conditions for the 18.2-year model period. The individual components tested are: berm height, width, length, and hydraulic conductivity; estuary hypsometry (storage to stage relationship); two factors that control wave-swash sedimentation of the inlet; and sea level rise. The elevation of the berm determines the volume of water that must enter the estuary in order to breach, and it modulates the wave-overtopping flux and frequency. By increasing estuary storage capacity, the estuary will breach less frequently (− 27\% change in time open for modeled excavation scenario) and store water up to 3 months later into the summer. Altering beach aquifer hydraulic conductivity affects inlet state, and patterns of breaching and water storage. As a result of sea-level rise of 1.67 m by 2100, and a beach berm that remains in its current location and accretes vertically, the amount of time the estuary remains open may decrease by 44\%. Such a change is an end-member of likely scenarios given that the berm will translate landwards. Model results indicate that the amount of time the estuary is open is more sensitive to changes in wave run-up than the amount of sand deposited in the inlet per each overtopping wave.},

	Abstract = {When a slowly varying wavetrain of small amplitude propagates in a general medium, changes of frequency and wavenumber are determined along definite paths known as rays. It is shown that, for a wide class of conservative systems in fluid dymamics changes in amplitude along the rays may be computed from conservation of wave action, which is defined as the wave energy divided by the intrinsic frequency. The intrinsic frequency is the frequency which would be measured by an observer moving with the local mean velocity of the medium. This result is the analogue for continuous systems of the adiabatic invariant for a classical simple harmonic oscillator. If the medium is time dependent or moving with a nonuniform mean velocity the intrinsic frequency is not normally constant, and wave energy is not conserved. Special cases include surface waves on a vertically uniform current in water of finite depth, internal gravity waves in a shear flow at large Richardson number, Alfv{\`e}n waves, sound waves, and inertial waves in a homogeneous rotating liquid in geostrophic mean motion.},

	Abstract = {Nearshore circulation and shoreline setup are forced through the wave radiation stress, which is a function of the frequency-directional wave spectrum. The radiation stress components often are approximated by assuming a spectrum that is narrow-band in frequency and direction. These narrow-band approximations overestimate the true radiation stress components in 8-m water depth on the Outer Banks, {NC} where locally generated (broad in frequency and direction) sea conditions are prevalent. Using the empirical Pierson-Moskowitz spectrum, frequency-spread is shown not to be the cause of this overestimation. Analytic expressions derived by Battjes [J. Mar. Res. 30 (1972) 56], for the ratio of true to narrow-band approximated radiation stress, which depend only on the directional spread, are compared to field data. The observed ratio of true to narrow-band approximated radiation stress is a strong function of the observed bulk (energy-weighted) directional spread, and closely follows the analytic expressions. Thus the narrow-band radiation stresses approximation can be augmented with a directional-spread dependence. These results are expected to apply to other geographic areas where waves are often locally generated.},

The field measurements showed the high {TKE} events occurred under wave crests, and sometimes under wave toughs, when the wave heights were increasing during the passage of a wave group; the {TKE} decreased after the maximum wave in the wave group had passed over the measurement location. High suspended sediment concentrations (ssc) and the intermittent high {TKE} events were not related rather the higher ssc events were associated with a secondary peak in the surface elevation, close to the maxima in the offshore velocity, and ``burst'' events in the Reynolds stress.},

	Abstract = {A study is made of the effect of wind and tides on the hydrodynamics of the shallow inner basins of mediterranean estuaries. The paper includes a case study of Harvey Estuary in southwestern Australia where salinity and temperature data exist for 11 years during the 1980s and 1990s when that estuary experienced massive annual blue-green algal blooms. An analysis is made of salt exchange through the channels that join estuarine basins of this class to either the ocean or, as in the case of Harvey Estuary, to another shallow estuarine basin. A detailed three-dimensional numerical model is also implemented for the basin of Harvey Estuary. It is concluded that exchange through the channel is dominated by the (mainly diurnal) tides, despite the general micro-tidal nature of this class of estuary, although the efficiency of this process is found to be controlled by the length of the channel. Wind set-up in the basin also produces channel exchange and for Harvey Estuary this is about 20\% of the exchange due to tides. Baroclinic flow through the channel is also capable of producing significant exchange but this is suppressed by the tidal currents in the channel except immediately after riverflow. Salt transport along the basins of this class of estuary is mainly driven by the longitudinal density gradient and the strength of this process is controlled by vertical mixing from the wind. However, there is also significant salt transport from wind-induced advection, the effect of which changes seasonally with the direction of the salt gradient.},

	Abstract = {El Yali coastal reserve is the most important wetland complex in Mediterranean climate central Chile, especially due to the native and foreign bird fauna which arrives here periodically. The coastal lagoon, part of a microtidal estuary (1.2m tidal range), is a shallow (\&lt; 1m depth) dynamic system and unique site of coexistence of northern halophyte and southern palustrian riparian vegetation. This study identifies and quantifies the effect of forcing variables in the lagoon water level over 1 year of data collection. Transects of piezometers with level sensors were installed between the coastal lagoon and the sea. Monthly water quality data were collected. During the winter rainy season, the lagoon connects with the sea via an ephemeral tidal inlet, producing noticeable daily variations in the water level, up to 80-cm depending on the tides. In contrast, during the season when bar closure of the inlet disconnects the lagoon from the sea, the lagoon level is very stable and only decreases very slowly due to evaporation, which also makes the system hypersaline. During the connection phase, analyses using general pattern, spectral and Fourier analysis of the sea-vs. lagoon-level signals show that two temporal scale hierarchies are relevant: monthly (due to moon cycles) and daily (due to tidal cycles every 12.5 and 24.2-h). A simple diffusion numerical model simulated the water table trends well for the sand bar between the lagoon and the sea, supporting the main effect of the sea level on the lagoon water levels.},

@article{munk_wind-driven_1950,
	Abstract = {Abstract Streamlines of oceanic mass transport are derived from solutions to a vertically integrated vorticity equation which relates planetary vorticity, lateral stress curl, and the curl of the stress exerted by the winds on the sea surface. These solutions account for many of the gross features of the general ocean circulation, and some of its details, on the basis of the observed mean annual winds. The solution for zonal winds (section 3) gives the main gyres of the ocean circulation. The northern and southern boundaries of these gyres are the west wind drift, the equatorial currents, and equatorial counter-current. They are determined by the westerly winds, the trades, and the doldrums, respectively. For each gyre the solution gives the following observed features (from west to east): a concentrated current (e.g., the Gulf Stream), a countercurrent, boundary vortices (the Sargasso Sea), and a steady compensating drift. Using mean Atlantic zonal winds, the solution yields a transport for the Gulf Stream of 36 million metric tons per second, compared to 74 million as derived from oceanographic observations. The discrepancy can probably be ascribed, at least in part, to an underestimate of the wind stress at low wind speeds (Beaufort 4 and less) as derived from the relationship now generally accepted. The solution for meridional winds (section 5) accounts for the main features of the current system off California. For a circular wind system (section 8) the solution gives a wind-spun vortex which is displaced westward in relation to the wind system, in agreement with observations in the Northeast Pacific high-pressure area. Based on these three solutions, a general nomenclature of ocean currents is introduced (section 9), applicable to all oceans regardless of hemisphere, and suggestive of the meteorologic features to which the currents are so closely related. In the light of this general system, the circulations of the northern and southern hemispheres, and of the North Atlantic and North Pacific are compared (section 10). Rossby's jet-stream theory of the Gulf Stream, and Maury's theory of thermohaline circulation are discussed, and it is concluded that the circulation in the upper layers of the oceans are the result chiefly of the stresses exerted by the winds.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}This paper provides a framework for the assessment of the natural sensitivity of coastal lagoons to anthropogenic and other external inputs. The assessment framework is based on analysis and consideration of morphometric characteristics, and is demonstrated in this paper using eight example intermittently open coastal lagoons from New South Wales, Australia. The framework presented extends to a rudimentary classification of the eight example coastal lagoons, relative to the other 70 or so intermittently open coastal lagoons in {NSW}, which can be used to provide an indication of the relative importance of these lagoons with respect to future management, such as remediation or conservation.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Morphometry describes the physical geographic characteristics of waterways such as coastal lagoons. Morphometric parameters are relatively easy to determine, as they essentially describe the physical and topographic features of waterways. Morphometry therefore provides a simple means to define the natural sensitivity, or vulnerability, of individual systems to external loads and other artificial (primarily anthropogenic) modifications.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Morphometric parameters, such as waterway area, waterway volume, waterway shape and the proportion of time that the entrance is either open or closed to the ocean, have been used to define three separate factors that each measures one aspect of the natural sensitivity, or vulnerability, of a coastal lagoon to external loads and other inputs. The first factor (called the Evacuation Factor) is a measure of how efficiently a coastal lagoon can remove pollutants and other inputs through tidal flushing (i.e. the tidal flushing efficiency). The second factor (called the Dilution Factor) is a measure of the relative difference between the input loads from the catchment and the resident volume of the coastal lagoon. The third factor (called the Assimilation Factor) is a measure of the water level variability in a coastal lagoon, which can subsequently influence the extent and diversity of biological processes and their capacity to assimilate or accommodate external inputs.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The morphometric-based assessment and classification framework presented in this paper could be applied to any country that contains a series of similar coastal lagoons that have intermittent connections to the ocean and which requires a relative assessment for prioritisation of future management and planning.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{baston_tsunami_2012,
	Abstract = {Abstract An aggregated model to evaluate tsunami response in semienclosed water bodies is presented in this work. The model is based on one-dimensional shallow water equations and can include long-wave external forcing such as a tsunami. It has been successfully validated against experimental data from a physical model, and its predictions for a case study have been compared with results from the Cornell multigrid coupled tsunami ({COMCOT}) model. The model can be used as a predictive tool because a calibration using a theoretical value for expansion and contraction losses has been performed and differences with the typical calibration are less than 10\%, which is considered acceptable. This allows using the model in the absence of measured data, which is very difficult to obtain in case of a tsunami event. A case study for the Gulf of C{\'a}diz (Spain) has been simulated with the {COMCOT} model. The aggregated model predicted the response for a harbor more accurately than for estuarine systems with tidal flats. Nevertheless, the aggregated model has been demonstrated as a useful general tool to predict the response of semienclosed tidal basins to a tsunami event, and hybrid models coupling advanced models to simulate ocean tsunami propagation with the model presented here would be useful in developing coastal warning alert systems.},

@article{hanes_waves_2011,
	Abstract = {Crissy Field Marsh ({CFM}; http://www.nps.gov/prsf/planyourvisit/crissy-field-marsh-and-beach.htm) is a small, restored tidal wetland located in the entrance to San Francisco Bay just east of the Golden Gate. The marsh is small but otherwise fairly typical of many such restored wetlands worldwide. The marsh is hydraulically connected to the bay and the adjacent Pacific Ocean by a narrow sandy channel. The channel often migrates and sometimes closes completely, which effectively blocks the tidal connection to the ocean and disrupts the hydraulics and ecology of the marsh. Field measurements of waves and tides have been examined in order to evaluate the conditions responsible for the intermittent closure of the marsh entrance. The most important factor found to bring about the entrance channel closure is the occurrence of large ocean waves. However, there were also a few closure events during times with relatively small offshore waves. Examination of the deep-water directional wave spectra during these times indicates the presence of a small secondary peak corresponding to long period swell from the southern hemisphere, indicating that {CFM} and San Francisco Bay in general may be more susceptible to long period ocean swell emanating from the south or southwest than the more common ocean waves coming from the northwest. The tidal records during closure events show no strong relationship between closures and tides, other than that closures tend to occur during multi-day periods with successively increasing high tides. It can be inferred from these findings that the most important process to the intermittent closure of the entrance to {CFM} is littoral sediment transport driven by the influence of ocean swell waves breaking along the {CFM} shoreline at oblique angles. During periods of large, oblique waves the littoral transport of sand likely overwhelms the scour potential of the tidal flow in the entrance channel.},

@article{ranasinghe_morphodynamic_1999,
	Abstract = {Seasonally open tidal inlets usually occur in microtidal, wave-dominated coastal environments where strong seasonal variations of streamflow and wave climate are experienced. These inlets are closed to the ocean for a number of months every year due to the formation of sand bars across their entrances. The annual closure of these inlets inhibits ocean access for boats and could also cause deterioration of water quality in the estuary/lagoon connected to the inlet. As these estuaries/lagoons are commonly used as harbours or recreational facilities there is increased interest in keeping the inlets permanently open. A process-based numerical model capable of simulating inlet closure is invaluable in terms of identifying the natural processes governing inlet closure. As a further step, this type of model could also be used to determine the effect of any proposed engineering solutions to keep the inlet open on the adjacent beaches. A morphodynamic model capable of simulating the seasonal closure of inlets, which includes both longshore ({LST}) and cross-shore transport ({CST}) processes, was developed in this study. Application of the model to two idealised scenarios indicated that cross-shore processes govern inlet behaviour when {LST} rates were low. The Dean's criterion [Dean, R.G., 1973. Heuristic models of sand transport in the surf zone. Proc. Conf. on Eng. Dynamics in the Surf Zone, Sydney, pp. 208-214.] for on-offshore transport was employed to show that, for small offshore wave incidence angles, onshore transport aided inlet closure when the offshore wave steepness (Ho/Lo) was less than the critical wave steepness (Ho/Lo)crit, while offshore transport helped to keep the inlet open when (Ho/Lo) was greater than (Ho/Lo)crit. {LST} was found to be the dominant process leading to inlet closure when (Ho/Lo) was much larger than (Ho/Lo)crit or when the offshore wave incidence angle was large.},

	Abstract = {A study of sea surface wave propagation and its energy deformation was carried out using field observations and numerical experiments over a region spanning the midshelf of the South Atlantic Bight ({SAB}) to the Altamaha River Estuary, {GA}. Wave heights on the shelf region correlate with the wind observations and directional observations show that most of the wave energy is incident from the easterly direction. Comparing midshelf and inner shelf wave heights during a time when there was no wind and hence no wave development led to an estimation of wave energy dissipation due to bottom friction with corresponding wave dissipation factor of 0.07 for the gently sloping continental shelf of the {SAB}. After interacting with the shoaling region of the Altamaha River, the wave energy within the estuary becomes periodic in time showing wave energy during flood to high water phase of the tide and very little wave energy during ebb to low water. This periodic modulation inside the estuary is a direct result of enhanced depth and current-induced wave breaking that occurs at the ebb shoaling region surrounding the Altamaha River mouth at longitude 81.23$\,^{\circ}$W. Modelling results with {STWAVE} showed that depth-induced wave breaking is more important during the low water phase of the tide than current-induced wave breaking during the ebb phase of the tide. During the flood to high water phase of the tide, wave energy propagates into the estuary. Measurements of the significant wave height within the estuary showed a maximum wave height difference of 0.4 m between the slack high water ({SHW}) and slack low water ({SLW}). In this shallow environment these wave--current interactions lead to an apparent bottom roughness that is increased from typical hydraulic roughness values, leading to an enhanced bottom friction coefficient.},

@article{jay_circulation_1990,
	Abstract = {This paper has two purposes. The first is to use tidal-monthly variations in the density and velocity fields and the salt and water transports as key to understanding the circulation of the Columbia River Estuary and other river estuaries. The Columbia River Estuary is a good natural laboratory in this regard, because the flushing time of the system (a few days) is short relative to the tidal month during all seasons. This allows the occurrence of distinct transitions from a strongly to a weakly stratified water column (and back) during the tidal month. Furthermore, because atmospheric processes are secondary to riverflow and tidal influence in determining the circulation, most of the energy in circulatory phenomena is confined to distinct tidal, tidal-monthly and seasonal frequency bands. Observations of salt transport and neap-spring transitions reported herein should provide important constraints on future theoretical studies of estuarine circulation.

The second purpose is to describe the circulation and density field of the Columbia River Estuary as background for understanding the geologic and biological investigations discussed in other papers in this volume. Previous investigations have focused on seasonal variations in riverflow as governing the turbidity maximum and biological productivity. Studies reported in this volume show that tidal monthly variations in circulatory processes are of comparable importance. With regard to the velocity field, the influence of stratification causes the tidal flow to show the largest vertical variations in phase and amplitude in the lower estuary. The vertical distribution of the mean current is controlled by the ebb-flood asymmetry in the time-dependent flow, vertical mixing processes, the baroclinic pressure gradient, and interaction of the flow with topography. Net upstream bottom flow is weak or absent during periods of weak stratification; it is substantially only when the system is highly stratified. Net upstream bottom flow tends to occur downstream of, and net downstream bottom flow upstream of, topographic highs. This pattern of convergences in the mean flow tends to preserve these topographic highs and lows and is not consistent with the traditional view that the baroclinic mean flow and mean salinity distribution structure one another; the former results instead primarily from ebb-flood asymmetry in the time-dependent flow.

Comprehensive salt transport calculations were carried out, because knowledge of salt transport variations during the tidal month is vital to understanding the causes of the observed transitions in the density and velocity fields that occur between extremes of tidal range. These calculations show that neap-spring and seasonal variability of the gross features of the salinity intrusion in the lower estuary is limited by compensating adjustments of the tidal advective and mean-flow salt transports under most riverflow conditions. In contrast, the absence of such balancing mechanisms in combination with substantial neap-spring changes in vertical mixing allow large variations in the density field and salinity intrusion length in the upper estuary. Neap-spring variability is much higher during the low-flow season than during the high-flow season. Under the lowest riverflow conditions permitted by the present dam system, large tidal monthly changes in stratification occur throughout the system.

The salt transport calculations also show that salt is carried into the estuary near mid-depth by tidal mechanisms acting primarily in the North Channel. Salt is transported out of the estuary closer to the surface of the South Channel by the strong mean flow. Mean velocities near the bottom are weak, and near-bottom, upstream salt transport by the mean flow is small. It is likely that inward tidal transport of salt occurs at mid-depth in many estuaries, as this is where salinity variations during the tidal cycle are usually greatest. Finally, the dynamical observations presented here, together with the known input of sediment from the river to the South Channel suggest that the concentration of fine sediment by the tidal asymmetry in a turbidity maximum should be stronger in the South than the North Channel. Limited observations confirm this.},

	Abstract = {The selective withdrawal of a linearly stratified fluid through a line sink at the base of a reservoir with a sill at the bed is investigated theoretically and experimentally. The nonlinear equations of motion are solved using a finite-difference technique in curvilinear coordinates in two dimensions. The evolution of selective withdrawal and the flow properties in the steady state are studied. Using the numerical results, an improvement is made to a previously proposed equation for the withdrawal-layer thickness upstream of a sill. Empirical equations are given for the critical Froude number and the density thickness. For comparison, experiments were conducted in a flume and particle image velocimetry technique was used to capture the flow field upstream of a sill during evolution of selective withdrawal. In general, good agreement is obtained between the numerical and experimental results. It is found that the presence of a sill causes the withdrawal layer to be thicker and to shift upward compared to the flat-bed case. The proposed equation for the withdrawal-layer thickness is verified experimentally.},

@article{geyer_dynamics_2000,
	Abstract = {Measurements of velocity. density, and pressure gradient in the lower   Hudson River estuary were used to quantify the dominant terms in the   momentum equation and to characterize their variations at tidal and   spring-neap timescales. The vertical momentum flux (assumed to be due   mainly to turbulent shear stress) was estimated indirectly, based on the   residual from the acceleration and pressure gradient terms. The indirect   estimates of stress compared favorably to bottom stress estimates using   a quadratic drag law, supporting the hypothesis that the tidal momentum   equation involves a local balance between tidal acceleration, pressure   gradient, and stress divergence.   Estimates of eddy viscosity indicated that there was significant tidal   asymmetry, with food tide values exceeding ebb values by a factor of 2.   As a consequence of the asymmetry, the vertical structure of the tidally   averaged stress bore no resemblance to the tidally averaged shear. In   spite of the asymmetry of vertical mixing, the tidally averaged,   estuarine circulation was found to depend simply on the intensify of   bottom turbulence, which could be parameterized by a Rayleigh drag   formulation based on the tidal velocity magnitude and the tidally   averaged near-bottom flow. This seemingly paradoxical result indicates   that the estuarine circulation can be modeled without detailed knowledge   of the effective eddy viscosity, only requiring an estimate of the   bottom drag coefficient. the tidal forcing conditions, and the   baroclinic pressure gradient. A notable characteristic of this solution   is an inverse dependence of the estuarine circulation on the amplitude   of the tides.},

@article{turner_double-diffusive_1978,
	Abstract = {It is now accepted that double-diffusive processes play a part in the mixing of heat and salt in the ocean and that relevant information about them can be obtained from laboratory experiments. There is still a considerable gap, however, between the laboratory work and the conditions under which the phenomena occur in the ocean. Most of the laboratory experiments have been one dimensional, whereas in the ocean, strong double-diffusive layering is often associated with large horizontal gradients of T and S, especially where water with one set of T-S properties intrudes at its own density level into an environment with different properties. The main purpose of the present paper is to report a series of laboratory experiments which are related to the latter case. The sugar-salt system and shadowgraph photography have been used to explore various situations of increasing complexity. The double-diffusive effects are compared with the behavior of a simple source of salt solution, which intrudes horizontally as a thin layer into a salinity gradient at its own density level. In strong contrast to this a source of sugar in the same salinity gradient produces vigorous vertical convection near the source, followed by spreading at several levels. The extending fluid moves out at an angle to the horizontal, rising or falling across isopycnals in a manner which can be related to the composition of the environment and source fluids and the double-diffusive transports across the boundaries of the intrusions. When the ambient fluid is set up with opposing gradients, so that potential energy is stored in one of the components, there is a more rapid spreading both horizontally and vertically, and strong shears are produced. The laboratory results are compared with published oceanic data to suggest explanations of some existing observations and to predict what might be measurable in future work.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}A synthesis of some results obtained over the period 1979-1982 from a study of beach and surf zone dynamics is presented. The paper deals with the different natural beach states, the process signatures associated with these states, environmental controls on modal beach state, and the temporal variability of beach state and beach profiles.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Hydrodynamic processes and the relative contributions of different mechanisms to sediment transport and morphologic change differ dramatically as functions of beach state, that is depending on whether the surf zone and beach are reflective, dissipative or in one of several intermediate states. Depending on beach state, near bottom currents show variations in the relative dominance of motions due to: incident waves, subharmonic oscillations, infragravity oscillations, and mean longshore and rip currents. On reflective beaches, incident waves and subharmonic edge waves are dominant. In highly dissipative surf zones, shoreward decay of incident waves is accompanied by shoreward growth of infragravity energy; in the inner surf zone, currents associated with infragravity standing waves dominate. On intermediate states with pronounced bar-trough (straight or crescentic) topographies, incident wave orbital velocities are generally dominant but significant roles are also played by subharmonic and infragravity standing waves, longshore currents, and rips. The strongest rips and associated feeder currents occur in association with intermediate transverse bar and rip topographies.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Long-term consecutive surveys of different beaches with contrasting local environmental conditions provide the data sets for empirical--statistical assessment of beach mobility, direction of change and response to environmental conditions. Conditions of persistently high wave energy combined with abundant and/or fine grained sediment results in maintaining highly dissipative states which exhibit very low mobility. Relatively low mobility is also associated with persistently low-steepness waves acting on coarsegrained beach sediments. In such cases, the modal beach state is reflective. The greatest degree of mobility is associated with intermediate but highly changeable wave conditions, medium grained sediment and a modest or meager sediment supply. Under such conditions, the beach and surf zone tend to alternate among the intermediate states and to exhibit well-developed bar trough and rhythmic topographies. A good association is found between beach state and the environmental parameter where Hb is breaker height, is mean sediment fall velocity and T is wave period. Temporal variability of beach state reflects, in part, the temporal variability and rate of change of [Omega], which, in turn depends on deep-water wave climate and nearshore wave modifications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A field program involving high-resolution velocity and density measurements, as well as high-frequency acoustic imagery, allowed direct comparison of instantaneous Richardson number distributions to the occurrence of shear instability. The theoretical stability threshold of 0.25 is consistent with the measurements, based on estimates of gradients that contain the mean as well as fluctuations due to internal waves. An effective stability threshold based on mean gradients is found to be approximately one-third, reflecting a significant contribution of internal wave shear. The integral effect of the mixing process is to homogenize the gradients of velocity and density, producing linear profiles of these quantities across the pycnocline. A turbulent Prandtl number of unity is suggested by the vertical distributions of velocity and density during periods of active vertical mixin...},

	Abstract = {Experimental and theoretical studies of stratified flow through outlets are reviewed, focusing on limiting height of aspiration, withdrawal layer thickness, and outflow concentration. First, a new non-dimensional criterion for limiting height of aspiration is proposed. It is found that this non-dimensional criterion changes only slightly for different kinds of selective withdrawal, including two-layer flow and linearly stratified flow through outlets at different levels. Therefore, if the salinity of density current and the outflow discharge are known, the limiting height of aspiration or the withdrawal layer thickness can be estimated. Second, characteristics of the outflow concentration of turbid density currents through outlets are studied. Based on the field observations in Sanmenxia Reservoir and Guanting Reservoir in China, as well as a number of laboratory experimental data from outlets in vertical walls and bottom outlets, a simplified model is developed to analyze the empirical relationship between outflow concentration and several critical parameters including outflow discharge, inflow sediment concentration, interface elevation, and outlet elevation. These research findings are readily applicable for outlet design, especially in sediment-laden waters.

	Abstract = {In this study, we examine the role that remotely forced ocean waves play in the hydrodynamics of an intertidal, estuarine mudflat. The observations indicate that long-period (10--20 s) ocean waves are a potentially important source of near-bed energy and shear stress in this environment. Over a two-week period in February 2001, we deployed an autonomous {SonTek} Hydra system on a mudflat in Central San Francisco Bay, and measured velocity and sediment concentration approximately 10 cm from the bed using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter ({ADV}) and an optical backscatter sensor ({OBS}). The experiment continued through wet (high tide) and dry (low tide) periods over an entire spring--neap cycle, and thus included the variation of near-bed velocity over a range of timescales. Results show that during large ebb tides, tidally forced flows dominate the near-bed dynamics during calm conditions. Wind waves dominate whenever the wind direction exposes the mudflat to wind coming off the bay (from the south and southwest), as occurs during winter storms. During periods when tidal forcing is limited and wind waves are small, remotely forced ocean swells become an important energy source. These motions appear in the burst samples at frequencies between 0.1 and 0.04 Hz and their energy correlates well (ρ\&gt;0.8) with ocean swell measured from a buoy offshore of San Francisco. Spectral analysis of data shows that the average energy of ocean waves per tide varied between 2 and 15\% of total energy load. Moreover, extreme values in the distribution of ocean waves bring episodic bursts of greater energy onto the estuarine mudflat, which may influence local suspension of sediments.},

The early estuary surveys of the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the compilation of species lists for individual systems, but contained very little biological or ecological information on fishes. These surveys were superseded by both autecological and synecological studies in the 1970s and 1980s, which yielded descriptive and process-orientated information on a wide variety of species. Estuarine research during the 1990s has focused increasingly at the community level, with several review papers on the life-history styles of groups of estuarine-associated fishes being published. The last decade has also seen the departure of a number of senior estuarine ichthyologists from the field. This decline in available expertise has coincided with increased demand for ichthyological information to be used in decision support systems for the wise management and conservation of estuaries. It is suggested that these demands be seen as a challenge, with studies being directed towards providing the type of information needed for the maintenance of vital ecological processes within these systems.},

A technique is developed for the estimation of current speeds within the entrance channel, on the basis of the definition of the ``apparent'' basin area. The results show that: (1) the ΩM ratio as one of stability criteria can be extended to include the influences of the characteristics of tides and freshwater discharges; (2) for inlet systems characterised by small flood and ebb tidal deltas and a pattern of by-passing of sediments due to tidal currents, the equilibrium cross-sectional area can be determined analytically; (3) the ratio of the difference between flood and ebb sediment discharges within the entrance to longshore sediment flux (i.e. the parameter k defined in the present study) can be used as a stability criterion; and (4) the evolution of an inlet system in response to an increase in longshore sediment flux appears to be characterised by a decrease in {AE} and a constant k value in early stages, but by a slow change in {AE} and a decrease in k in later stages (hence, these two stability criteria can be combined to describe the inlet behaviours in response to sediment movement, for different stages of evolution).},

	Abstract = {Estuaries are highly productive areas that serve as important nursery   habitat for many species of fish. Estuaries provide juvenile salmonids   Oncorhynchus spp. with foraging habitats, refuge from predators, and   areas in which smoltification and orientation for return migrations can   occur. Our primary goal was to describe how juvenile salmonids use the   Smith River estuary in northern California, a system that is largely   devoid of instream cover and the slough habitat it once contained. The   presence of juvenile salmonids was quantified through direct observation   (snorkel surveys) and calculations of relative densities in the   midchannel and stream margin habitats of the estuary. We completed a   total of 755 dives between May 1999 and November 2000. We found that   significant differences existed between the relative densities of   juvenile Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha and trout (coastal cutthroat   trout O. clarkii clarkii and steelhead O. mykiss) observed in habitats   with and without cover along stream margins. Stepwise logistic analysis   was used to correlate the presence or absence of Chinook salmon and   trout to stream reach, habitat type, flow (m(3)/s), salinity (\%o),   temperature (degrees C), and depth (m). In general, juvenile salmonids   appeared to preferentially use habitats with overhanging riparian   vegetation. However, Chinook salmon presence was most correlated with   areas of low salinity ({\textless}5\%o), while trout presence was most influenced   by habitat type. Trout were present most often in stream margin   habitats, regardless of other physical factors. Our study demonstrates   that riparian vegetation may be an essential component of juvenile   salmonid rearing habitat in estuaries with little instream cover.},

	Abstract = {This letter systematically reviews and synthesizes scientific and gray literature publications (n = 420) to identify and characterize the nature of climate change vulnerability in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region of the western Canadian Arctic and identify gaps in understanding. The literature documents widespread evidence of climate change, with implications for human and biophysical systems. Adaptations are being employed to manage changing conditions and are indicative of a high adaptive capacity. However, barriers to adaptation are evident and are expected to constrain adaptive capacity to future climate change. Continued climate change is predicted for the region, with differential exposure sensitivity for communities, groups and sectors: a function of social--economic--biophysical characteristics and projected future climatic conditions. Existing climate risks are expected to increase in magnitude and frequency, although the interaction between projected changes and socio-economic--demographic trends has not been assessed. The capacity for adapting to future climate change has also not been studied. The review identifies the importance of targeted vulnerability research that works closely with community members and other stakeholders to address research needs. Importantly, the fully categorized list of reviewed references accompanying this letter will be a valuable resource for those working or planning to work in the region, capturing climate change research published since 1990. At a broader level, the systematic review methodology offers a promising tool for climate/environmental change studies in general where there is a large and emerging body of research but limited understanding of research gaps and needs.},

@article{boegman_vertical_2008,
	Abstract = {Zebra mussels ( Dreissena polymorpha) are an invasive species that have   been implicated in the reduction of algae stocks in the near-shore   environment of western Lake Erie. To determine their basin-wide effects,   we applied a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water-quality model for   1994. The model accurately reproduced lake-wide hydrodynamics and water   quality. When modeled as true benthic organisms ( resting on the   bottom), the dreissenids grazed 53\% of the western basin May through   September net algal growth. This grazing resulted in a similar to 0.1 mg   L(-1) reduction in the pelagic algae concentration relative to the case   without dreissenids. In comparison, dreissenids grazed 77\% western basin   net algal growth when the lake was modeled as a fully mixed water   column. We found that the biomass grazed was governed by a balance   between the timescales of vertical wind-induced mixing and benthic   grazing. During calm conditions, weak diurnal stratification (similar to   1 degrees C between surface and bottom waters) was sufficient to   suppress vertical mixing, when the mean daily wind speed 4 m above the   lake surface ( U(4)) was {\textless} 6 m s(-1). These conditions allowed a   concentration boundary layer similar to 1 m thick to form, accounting   for the reduced grazing effect relative to the fully mixed case.   Entrainment of the concentration boundary layer occurred for U(4){\textgreater} 6 m   s(-1) ( associated with the lake's characteristic 10- d storm cycle)   facilitating algae supply to the benthos. We formulated the mean daily   biomass grazed in terms of the dreissenid areal pumping rate ( a) and U4   and found that because typically U4 is,6 m s21, the western basin is   weakly stratified thermally and a concentration boundary layer forms   when U(4){\textless} 3 alpha or alpha {\textgreater} 2 m(3) m(-2) d(-1). The dynamics of both   wind-mixing and thermal stratification must, therefore, be considered in   mixing models applied to shallow weakly stratified lake basins.},

@article{mathis_modeling_2014,
	Abstract = {Recently, Mathis et al. (2013) developed a model for predicting the instantaneous fluctuations of the wall shear-stress in turbulent boundary layers. This model is based on an inner-outer scale interaction mechanism, incorporating superposition, and amplitude-modulation effects, and the only input required for the model is a time series measurement of the streamwise velocity signal taken in the logarithmic region of the flow. The present study applies this new approach for the first time to environmental flows, for which the near-bed information is typically inaccessible. The data used here are acoustic Doppler velocimeter time series measurements from a shallow tidal channel (Suisun Slough in North San Francisco Bay). We first extract segments of data sharing properties with canonical turbulent boundary layers. The wall (bed) shear-stress model is then applied to these selected data. Statistical and spectral analysis demonstrates that the field data predictions are consistent with laboratory and {DNS} results. The model is also applied to the whole available data set to demonstrate, even for situations far from the canonical boundary layer case, its ability to preserve the overall Reynolds number trend. The predicted instantaneous bed stress is highly skewed and amplitude modulated with the variations in the large-scale streamwise velocity. Finally, the model is compared to conventional methods employed to predict the bed shear-stress. A large disparity is observed, but the present model is the only one able to predict both the correct spectral content and the probability density function.},

@article{shaw_morphology_2013,
	Abstract = {River deltas are classic depositional systems, but a growing body of literature shows that their channel networks can be erosional. Furthermore, this erosion can attack channel beds of consolidated mud that acts as bedrock. To better understand the channel networks of natural deltas and engineered river diversions, we investigate bathymetric and planimetric change, bed cover, and sediment transport in the Wax Lake Delta ({WLD}) in coastal Louisiana, {USA}. Channels have eroded up to 40\% of modern flow depth between the {WLD}'s initiation in 1973 and 1999. Aerial image analysis shows that channels have widened by 11\% between 1991 and 2009, forcing the downstream migration of islands. Channel beds are composed of 85--98\% muddy bedrock, with the remainder covered by alluvial sands. Water velocity, grain size, and suspended sand concentration measurements during the 2009 spring flood show that almost all available grain sizes are transported in suspension. Flow was supply limited during this period, with the calculated sand concentration at the height of the bed load layer is 1--4 orders of magnitude smaller than predicted for saturated sand transport. We test ``the cover effect'' and ``the tools effect'' previously proposed for bedrock erosion in upland river channels. Bedrock erosion and alluvial cover are anti-correlated (the cover effect), but the observations do not closely follow previously proposed relationships. The difference in erosion rate between clear water and sand-rich water shows that abrasion by sand (the tools effect) accounts for 51\% $\pm$ 56\% of bedrock erosion when it is present.},

@article{de_swart_initial_2009,
	Abstract = {An idealised model is presented and analysed to gain more fundamental understanding about the dynamics of phytoplankton blooms in well-mixed, suspended sediment dominated estuaries. The model describes the behaviour of subtidal currents, suspended sediments, nutrients and phytoplankton in a channel geometry. The initial growth of phytoplankton and its spatial distribution is calculated by solving an eigenvalue problem. The growth rates depend on the position in the estuary due to along-estuary variations in nutrient concentration and suspended sediment concentration. The model yields an insight into how the onset of blooms in the model depends on physical and biological processes (turbulent mixing, fresh water discharge, light attenuation, imposed nutrient concentrations at the river and sea side). In particular, the model demonstrates that the joint action of spatial variations in turbidity and in nutrients causes the maximum phytoplankton concentrations to occur seaward of the estuarine turbidity maximum.},

In situ optical backscatterance sensors provide continuous suspended-sediment concentration data, but inaccessibility, vandalism, and cost limit the number of potential monitoring stations. Satellite imagery reveals the spatial distribution of surficial-suspended sediment concentrations in the Bay; however, temporal resolution is poor. Analysis of thein situ sensor data in conjunction with the satellite reflectance data shows the effects of physical processes on both the spatial and temporal distribution of suspended sediment in San Francisco Bay. Plumes can be created by large freshwater flows. Zones of high suspended-sediment concentrations in shallow subembayments are associated with wind-wave resuspension and the spring-neap cycle. Filaments of clear and turbid water are caused by different transport processes in deep channels, as opposed to adjacent shallow water. Crown},

Physical modelling of an undular bore has been conducted based upon a quasi-steady flow analogy. The experimental data highlight rapid flow redistributions between successive wave troughs and crests as well as large bottom shear stress variations. The results suggest a sediment transport process combining scour beneath wave troughs associated with upward matter dispersion between a trough and the following wave crest. The process is repeated at each trough and significant sediment transport takes place with deposition in upstream intertidal zones. The conceptual model is supported by field observations showing murky waters after the bore passage and long-lasting chaotic waves.},

A wave field is presented for a vertically fronted wave and comparison is made with an appropriate numerical study. The velocities obtained are far in excess of the predictions of linear theory.

Measurements have also been made of the forces produced by this wave on a horizontal cylinder. Comparisons with large regular waves indicate that forces due to breaking waves can be up to five times greater for similar wave heights.},

The Mackenzie Delta, a biologically significant and resource-rich region in northwestern Canada, is particularly vulnerable to flooding by storm surges. To properly manage the consequences of climate warming for Arctic residents, infrastructure, and ecosystems, a better understanding of the influence of climate change on storm surge activity is required. Here we use particle size analysis of lake sediment records to show that the occurrence and magnitude of storm surges in the outer Mackenzie Delta are significantly related to temperature and that the frequency and intensity of storm surges is increasing. Our results demonstrate the effects of changing climate on storm surge activity and provide a cautionary example of the threat of inundation to low-lying Arctic coastal environments under future climate warming scenarios.},

@article{matthews_spring_1984,
	Abstract = {Simpson Lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from the Beaufort Sea by a chain of low-lying barrier islands. Narrow channels are found between the barrier islands, one of which, the Egg Island Channel, is a major connection between the lagoon and the Beaufort Sea. The Kuparuk River produces great quantities of springtime floodwaters which overflow the still-frozen lagoon. This paper examines the relationships between these floodwaters and the character of the water within the lagoon. Measurements of temperature, salinity, sea level, and currents have been made in Egg Island Channel during 1978 and 1979. Meltwater from the Kuparuk River was observed on satellite images to overflow the 2-m-thick bottomfast ice of the lagoon in late May and early June. These floodwaters flush saline ({\textgreater}40‰) water out the 5-m deep channel and replace it with freshwater at 0$\,^{\circ}$C. Analysis of satellite images for several years shows that overflow occurs on May 31 with a standard deviation of 8 days. Sea level rose 64 cm above mean at peak flood in 1978. Subsequently, channel waters warmed to 8$\,^{\circ}$C in late June and were flushed by cold (∼0$\,^{\circ}$C, saline (∼24‰) water from the Beaufort Sea in mid-July. Flooding in 1979 was anomalously early, providing additional insight into the flushing process. The return of seawater to the channel is due to wind-driven currents following the clearing of bottomfast ice in the lagoon. Satellite image analysis shows that ice-free conditions occur by July 10 with a standard deviation of 8 days.},

@article{blanton_effect_2000,
	Abstract = {We describe the tidal circulation and salinity regime of a coastal plain estuary that connects to the ocean through a flood tide delta. The delta acts as a sill, and we examine the mechanisms through which the sill affects exchange of estuarine water with the ocean. Given enough buoyancy, the dynamics of tidal intrusion fronts across the sill and selective withdrawal (aspiration) in the deeper channel landward appear to control the exchange of seawater with estuarine water. Comparison of currents on the sill and stratification in the channel reveals aspiration depths smaller than channel depth during neap tide. During neap tide and strong vertical stratification, seawater plunges beneath the less dense estuarine water somewhere on the sill. Turbulence in the intruding bottom layer on the sill promotes entrainment of fluid from the surface layer, and the seawater along the sill bottom is diluted with estuarine water. During ebb flow, salt is effectively trapped landward of the sill in a stagnant zone between the aspiration depth and the bottom where it can be advected farther upstream by flood currents. During spring tide, the plunge point moves landward and off the sill, stratification is weakened in the deep channel, and aspiration during ebb extends to the bottom. This prevents the formation of stagnant water near the bottom, and the estuary is flooded with high salinity water far inland. The neapspring cycle of tidal intrusion fronts on flood coupled with aspiration during ebb interacts with the sill to play an important role in the transport and retention of salt within the estuary.},

@article{bertin_tidal_2005,
	Abstract = {Tidal inlet characteristics are controlled by wave energy, tidal range, tidal prism, sediment supply and direction and rates of sand delivered to the inlet. This paper deals with the relations between inlet and lagoon evolutions, linked by the tidal prism. Our study is focused on the Maumusson Inlet and the Marennes-Ol{\'e}ron Bay (first oyster farming area in Europe), located on the western coast of France. The tidal range (2--6 m) and wave climate (mean height: 1.5 m) place this tidal inlet system in the mixed energy (tide, waves), tide-dominated category. The availability of high-resolution bathymetric data since 1824 permits to characterise and quantify accurately morphological changes of both the inlet and the tidal bay. Since 1824, sediment filling of the tidal bay has led to a 20\% decrease in its water volume, and a 35\% reduction of the inlet throat section. Furthermore, the bay is subjected to a very high anthropic pressure, mainly related to oyster farming. Thus, both natural and human-related processes seem relevant to explain high sedimentation rates. Current measurements, hydrodynamic modelling and cross-sectional area of the inlet throat are used in order to quantify tidal prism changes since 1824. Both flood and ebb tidal prism decreased by 35\%. Decrease in the Marennes-Ol{\'e}ron Bay water volume is inferred to be responsible for a part of tidal prism decrease at the inlet. Tidal prisms decrease may also be explained by an increase in frictional resistance to tidal wave propagation, due to a general shoaling and oyster farms in the bay. A conceptual model is proposed, taking into account natural and human-related sedimentation processes, and explaining tidal inlet response to tidal bay evolutions.},

@article{imberger_flux_1998-1,
	Abstract = {This review focuses on clarifying the energy transfer mechanisms operating in a stratified lake. The energy imparted by the wind to the lake leads to basin scale waves which may be identified as Kelvin or Poincar{\'e} waves or simple gravitational seiching; the vertical model structure of these waves appears to depend on the wind forcing and the basin slope, but most of the energy resides in the first and second modes. Once established these basin scale waves steepen due to non-linear processes and due to shoaling forming a spectrum of internal wave motions within the metalimnion with frequencies from about 10−6 Hz to 10−2 Hz depending on the size of the lake and the severity of the stratification. The waves at the high frequency end of the spectrum are often highly non-linear and are best described as solitary waves, bores and hydraulic jumps.It is shown that waves in the frequency range from 5 times 10−5 to 10−2 Hz are close to critical with respect to typical bottom slopes. A review of internal wave reflection showed that for such incident waves most of the incident internal wave energy is dissipated at the boundary. This is also true for isolated solitary waves. There are thus two energy sources for the maintenance of the benthic boundary layer. First, at the level of the metalimnion incident internal wave modes break giving up their energy, and second, the velocity field associated with the first mode heaving leads to shear production at the lake bottom in the deeper parts of a lake basin.Recent evidence also suggests that the composite internal wave field gives rise to turbulent patches in the metalimnion and to a lesser extent in the hypolimnion. The great majority of the turbulent events have very small displacement scales and are thus inefficient at transporting mass vertically, even though the mean dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy may be as high as 10−8 m2 s−3.It appears that mass is thus transferred vertically in two ways in a stratified lake. First, through the benthic boundary layer, and second, to a much lesser extent directly by intermittent turbulent mixing.},

@article{becker_artificial_2009,
	Abstract = {Fish kills are not uncommon within estuaries in many regions of the world. In seasonally open systems, which are common in temperate areas, they are often associated with mouth openings. Such a kill occurred in July 2005 in the Surrey Estuary following a closed mouth period of seven months resulting in the loss of many thousands of fish. At the time the fish community within the estuary was under investigation which provided comprehensive data of this population prior to the kill. Monthly water quality monitoring was also being conducted prior to the kill and also carried out on a daily basis following the mouth opening. The Surrey was stratified during the closed mouth phase, isolated waters below the halocline had stagnated and become anoxic. As a result only waters above the halocline contained oxygen concentrations capable of sustaining most fish. It appears that if a mouth opening happens under low flow conditions, a shearing effect occurs within the water column where surface waters flow out to sea leaving deeper waters behind. This resulted in only anoxic waters being present for in excess of six days and was responsible for the fish kill. Fish sampling of the Surrey Estuary was conducted three and six months following the kill and those data were compared to that collected in the 12 months prior to the event. Three months after the kill few fish were collected within the estuary and included marine opportunists near the mouth and estuarine resident species in the far upper reaches of the system. However six months following the kill large numbers of estuarine resident species were collected throughout the Surrey Estuary. As many species were euryhaline, it is believed that some individuals migrated into freshwater reaches of the Surrey to escape the anoxic conditions within the estuary. As conditions improved they recolonised the Surrey Estuary. The high fecundity and rapid growth of these small, short lived species probably aided in their re-establishing populations within the estuary. It is clear from this research that artificial openings of estuaries should be avoided during low flow periods when oxygen concentrations are low. It also appears that many of the small estuarine resident species common in seasonally open estuaries are capable of recolonising estuaries following fish kills. The effects on larger, longer lived resident species are not known but likely to be more detrimental due to longer time required for them to reach sexual maturity.},

	Abstract = {This study investigates the relations between watershed precipitation, upstream channel slope, and the geomorphology of 19 small (40 to 18,658 m 2 ), fluvial-incised lagoons in the actively uplifting piedmont near Santa Barbara, {CA}. Lagoons in the study are funnel-shaped, shallow (\&lt;2 m), river-dominated, and enclosed by a sandy to cobble-sized beach barrier for much of the year. Results indicate a strong link between watershed processes and lagoon geomorphology, such that a significant portion of the variability in lagoon area, length, volume, average width, circularity, and lagoon width expansion can be explained by the variability of watershed precipitation and channel slope upstream of the lagoons. Performing multiple regression analysis with watershed precipitation and channel slope as independent variables, coefficients of determination for the power function regressions are 0.88 (lagoon area), 0.88 (lagoon volume), 0.83 (lagoon volume), and 0.74 (average width). Upstream slope is the best single predictor of lagoon geomorphology.},

	Abstract = {An 18-month time series of temperature collected in the vicinity of the Guadalquivir estuary mouth has been analyzed to investigate tidal signals in the temperature records. Two sources of similar importance are acting jointly to produce these signals, the gravitational tide generating potential that acts through the tidal currents induced by the vertical tide at the estuary's mouth and the radiational potential whose origin is the sun's radiation. The most important signal is the radiational diurnal S1, which exhibits a seasonal modulation. The next one in importance is M2, introduced via the advective term, which shows semiannual modulation due to the change of sign of the horizontal temperature gradient. The S2 constituent is a mixture of radiational (via the first harmonic of S1) and gravitational contributions, the former being about twice the latter. The harmonic constants of all these constituents are time-dependent so that caution is needed to interpret results deduced from time series of few months.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
Low-frequency (infragravity) wave dynamics on a fringing coral reef were investigated using the numerical model {XBeach} (Roelvink et al., 2009). First, the skill of the model was evaluated in one- and two-dimensions based on its predictions of short waves (0.04--0.2 Hz), infragravity waves (0.004--0.04 Hz) and water level measurements (tidal and wave setup) obtained during a 2009 field study at Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia. The model calibration was sensitive to friction coefficients for short waves and current/infragravity bed friction, which were assumed independent in this model study. Although the one-dimensional cross-shore model captured the gradients in the dominant hydrodynamic processes at the site, a high current/{IG} bed friction coefficient was required. This resulted in an overestimation and a phase lag between the observed and predicted wave setup signal. In the two-dimensional model, a lower (more realistic) current/infragravity wave friction coefficient was required to achieve optimum performance due to the presence of significant reef and lagoon mean flows in the model, which led to reduced setup across the reef. The infragravity waves were found to propagate from the surf zone across the reef in a dominantly cross-shore direction towards the shore, but with substantial frictional damping. The infragravity waves were strongly modulated also over the reef by tidal depth variations, primarily due to the variability in frictional dissipation rates when the total water depth over the reef varied. Two mean wave-driven circulation cells were observed in the study area, with cross-shore flow becoming more alongshore-dominated before exiting the system via the two channels in the reef. The results reveal that short waves dominated bottom stresses on the forereef and near the reef crest; however, inside the lagoon, infragravity waves become increasingly dominant, accounting up to 50\% of the combined bottom stresses.},

@article{robertson_lake_2007,
	Abstract = {Lake Number, {LN}, values are shown to be quantitative indicators of deep mixing in lakes and reservoirs that can be used to estimate changes in deep water dissolved oxygen ({DO}) concentrations. {LN} is a dimensionless parameter defined as the ratio of the moments about the center of volume of the water body, of the stabilizing force of gravity associated with density stratification to the destabilizing forces supplied by wind, cooling, inflow, outflow, and other artificial mixing devices. To demonstrate the universality of this parameter, {LN} values are used to describe the extent of deep mixing and are compared with changes in {DO} concentrations in three reservoirs in Australia and four lakes in the U.S.A., which vary in productivity and mixing regimes. A simple model is developed which relates changes in {LN} values, i.e., the extent of mixing, to changes in near bottom {DO} concentrations. After calibrating the model for a specific system, it is possible to use real-time {LN} values, calculated using water temperature profiles and surface wind velocities, to estimate changes in {DO} concentrations (assuming unchanged trophic conditions).},

@article{picado_tidal_2010,
	Abstract = {Although rising global sea levels will affect the estuarine flooded areas over the coming decades, the local and regional-scale processes will also induce important changes in these coastal systems. The main aim of this work is to investigate possible tidal changes in estuarine systems induced by local geomorphologic modifications, analysing the particular case of Ria de Aveiro which is in risk of inundation. Located in the Portuguese west coast, this tidally driven lagoon has a large area of mostly abandoned salt pans, which are in progressive degradation caused by the lack of maintenance and by the strong currents which erode their protective walls.

To explore possible tidal changes the hydrodynamic model {ELCIRC} was applied to Ria de Aveiro to simulate and analyse the impact in the lagoon hydrodynamics of this degradation which results in the enlargement of the lagoon flooded area. A high-resolution grid (grid spacing of the order of 1 m) was developed in order to represent the narrow channels adjacent to the salt pans. The hydrodynamic model was then successfully calibrated and assessed for skill for the Aveiro lagoon through comparison between measurements and model results and quantification of the numerical accuracy. The model was subsequently used to investigate the effect of the flooded lagoon area enlargement on tidal propagation in Ria de Aveiro. Simulations were performed for three geomorphologic configurations, representing the reference or present situation and two flooded scenarios. Results were compared through the analysis of tidal currents, tidal asymmetry and tidal prism.

The increase of the lagoon flooded area results in an intensification of the tidal currents, tidal prism and tidal asymmetry. Results also indicate that the tidal prism further increases when the flooding depth increases. Otherwise, changes in tidal currents and in tidal asymmetry pattern are negligible with the increase of the flooded area depth.

These results indicate that modifications of the flooded area of estuarine systems will result in tidal changes, with an intensification of the actual tidal patterns induced by the enlargement of inundation areas.},

@article{wallerstein_shock_1992,
	Abstract = {The phenomenon of ocean waves breaking on a beach is analogous to shock waves in the atmosphere of a pulsating star. In both cases a velocity discontinuity is clearly present. In stars the upper, expanding layer halts and falls back so as to interact with the rising gas at a shock. Similarly, a bore on a beach reaches its maximum extension before sliding back onto the next incoming wave. Analogous quantities such as the surface gravity of the star and the beach gradient in the ocean have similar effects on the flows and the nature of the discontinuity between them. Phenomena that are not analogous include the thermodynamic properties of the two media. Ocean observations may help solve some problems in shock phenomena associated with stellar pulsation.},

@article{ginsburg_influence_1958,
	Abstract = {Physical forces and topography control the depositional environments of shelf and shallow-water sediments. However, certain bottom communities are capable of modifying water circulation and bottom conditions sufficiently to produce recognizably different sediments than those deposited without the organisms. The organisms responsible for such modifications may or may not be sediment contributors, and their sphere of influence can be limited to their habitat or can extend well beyond it. The biotic modifications of the physical environment constitute a grading spectrum of increasing influence, ranging from the trapping and binding of individual sediment particles by organic films, such as mats of blue-green algae, to the quiet-water lagoonal conditions produced by barrier reefs miles beyond their growth limits. The recognition of the influence of the organisms is based on anomalous structures, textures, or faunas of the sediments that cannot readily be explained solely by variations in physical factors or topography. Stabilization of the sediment by the community is also required if its influence is to be preserved. The best-known fossil examples of community influence on depositional environment are algal stromatolites and organic reefs; other examples are expected throughout the geologic past.},

@article{garden_spit_2005,
	Abstract = {Although the importance of estuaries as ecological, geomorphological and sedimentological systems is well recognised and a number of estuarine classification schemes are referred to in literature, geomorphological behaviour of small estuaries such as those on the {KwaZulu}-Natal coast are not well understood. In particular the development and role of spits and bars in the functioning of small, perched estuaries needs clarification. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of spit initiation and growth in the Mdloti estuary, a small perched estuary some 25km north of Durban, on the {KwaZulu}-Natal coast, with a view to developing an hypothesis which explains the procedure of split development and its role in the geomorphological life of the estuary. Seven generations of air photos from 1953 to 2000 were analysed, and sediment samples from four trenches and two cores located on the spit allowed recent sedimentological history to be interpreted and integrated with geomorphological development of the mouth over the last 50 years. Results showed that infrastructural developments in the upper estuary and artificial breaching of the of the mouth all had significance in determining estuarine behaviour, but that spit initiation and development after breaching was largely dependent on long-shore sediment transport. The results allowed the proposition of a sequential model for spit development for the Mdloti estuary subsequent to breaching during a flood. An offshore delta is formed by the flood and later joined by a spit bar built up by longshore drift. Ebb delta deposits are re-worked by longshore currents. As the new bar becomes emergent aeolian activity commences and the spit is gradually widened by overwash deposits, and growth continues until the estuary is completely closed off.},

@article{godo_observation_2001,
	Abstract = {A response in movement of a two-layered water body in Lake Nakaumi to a strong wind, which suddenly rose and continued for 15 h with nearly constant speed and direction, was observed using the current and salinity meters situated at two points in the lake. At the initial stage of water movement, large fluctuations in current velocity in reverse directions were observed in the upper and lower layers, accompanied by mixing between the two layers. At the stationary stage following the initial stage, current velocities in the upper and lower layers were kept constant, as was salinity. It was considered that a slab-type flow, which enhanced mixing between the two layers, occurred at the initial stage in water movement, then changed into a steady circulation flow at the stationary stage with completion of the set up in the two-layered structure.},

	Abstract = {A growing concern has been expressed by educators and policymakers alike over the small number of women pursuing careers in the scientific, mathematical, and technical fields (e.g., Sells, 1980). Despite efforts to ameliorate this through affirmative action and scholarship programs, employment statistics indicate that men and women are still entering these career fields in disproportionate numbers (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1980). Women are less likely than men to enter professions that are math related. For example, in 1983, women received only 13.2\% of all undergraduate degrees in engineering and only 27\% of all undergraduate degrees in the physical sciences. In contrast, females received 68\% of the undergraduate degrees in psychology and sociology and 75\% of the undergraduate degrees in education (Vetter and Babco, 1986).},

@article{bromirski_transoceanic_2010,
	Abstract = {Long-period oceanic infragravity ({IG}) waves (ca. [250, 50] s period) are generated along continental coastlines by nonlinear wave interactions of storm-forced shoreward propagating swell. Seismic observations on the Ross Ice Shelf show that free {IG} waves generated along the Pacific coast of North America propagate transoceanically to Antarctica, where they induce a much higher amplitude shelf response than ocean swell (ca. [30, 12] s period). Additionally, unlike ocean swell, {IG} waves are not significantly damped by sea ice, and thus impact the ice shelf throughout the year. The response of the Ross Ice Shelf to {IG}-wave induced flexural stresses is more than 60 {dB} greater than concurrent ground motions measured at nearby Scott Base. This strong coupling suggests that {IG}-wave forcing may produce ice-shelf fractures that enable abrupt disintegration of ice shelves that are also affected by strong surface melting. Bolstering this hypothesis, each of the 2008 breakup events of the Wilkins Ice Shelf coincides with wave-model-estimated arrival of {IG}-wave energy from the Patagonian coast.},

Concepts are explored using a realistic numerical simulation of the Columbia River estuary. The isohaline method is found to be advantageous because it intrinsically highlights the salinity classes in which subtidal volume flux occurs. The resulting expressions give rise to an exact formulation of the time-dependent Knudsen relation and may be used in calculation of the saltwater residence time. The volume flux of the landward transport, which can be calculated precisely using the isohaline framework, is of particular importance for problems in which the saltwater residence time is critical.},

@article{harcourt-baldwin_numerical_2006,
	Abstract = {The coastal region adjacent to Tomales Bay, California is dominated by wind-driven upwelling during spring and summer and the cold, upwelled water is moved towards Tomales Bay, entering the estuary with the flood tide. If the tidal excursion is ≥6 km and the cold water subducts beneath the warmer, less dense estuarine water, a temperature controlled density current may form and intrude towards the head of the estuary as a thermally stratified bottom layer. The numerical modelling was aimed at determining the capability of the Delft3D-{FLOW} model to reproduce the cold ocean water intrusion events, the response (development and progression) of these intrusions to differing physical scenarios and the comparative importance of the parameters to the intrusions. The numerical model successfully reproduced the density intrusions and showed that the persistence and break down of the density intrusions were affected by a number of physical parameters, to varying degrees. The sensitivity analysis showed that density intrusion formation is controlled by tidal conditions and ocean water temperature. The strength and persistence of the developed density intrusions are influenced by wind, insolation and estuary depth. Fresh water inflow at the head of the estuary had no impact on the density intrusions. Three-dimensional numerical modelling is thus a valuable tool in understanding the estuary and its functioning.},

@article{roegner_juvenile_2010,
	Abstract = {Degraded wetland systems with impaired hydraulic connections have   resulted in diminished habitat opportunity for salmonid fishes and other   native flora and fauna in the Pacific Northwest. Many of these lost   habitats were once intertidal freshwater marshes and swamps. Restoration   of these systems is effected in part by reestablishing tidal processes   that promote connectivity, with a central goal of restoring rearing   habitat for juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. In the Grays River   tidal freshwater system of Washington, we measured hydrologic changes   that resulted from the removal of tide gates from diked pastureland and   we determined the subsequent time series of salmonid abundance and size   frequency in the restoring marshes. Dike breaching caused an immediate   return of full semidiurnal tidal fluctuations to the pasturelands.   Juvenile Pacific salmonids quickly expanded into this newly available   habitat and used prey items that were presumably produced within the   marshes. Habitat use varied by species and life history stage. Fry of   chum salmon O. keta migrated rapidly through the system, whereas   populations of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha and coho salmon O. kisutch   resided from March to at least July and were composed of fry,   fingerlings, and (for coho salmon) yearlings. Based on salmon size at   date and the timing of hatchery releases, we concluded that most salmon   sampled in restored and reference sites were the progeny of natural   spawners. However, the presence of adipose-fin-clipped Chinook salmon   indicated that hatchery-raised fish originating outside the Grays River   system also used the restoring wetland habitat. Because of extensive   mixing of stocks through hatchery practices, genetic analyses did not   provide additional insight into the origins of the Chinook salmon but   did reveal that out-migrating juveniles were an admixed population   composed of lower Columbia River ancestry and nonindigenous Rogue River   stock. Restoration of tidal wetlands in the Columbia River estuary will   improve overall ecosystem connectivity and reduce habitat fragmentation   and may therefore increase survival of a variety of Pacific salmon   stocks during migration.},

@article{antenucci_energetics_2001,
	Abstract = {An analytical model is used to determine dispersion relations and the ratio of potential to kinetic energy in linear basin-scale internal waves in lakes affected by the earth's rotation. It is shown that the wave frequency and energy partitioning in elliptic lakes are dependent only on the direction of propagation relative to the earth's rotation, the aspect ratio, the horizontal mode (azimuthal and radial), and the Burger number (S(i) = c(i)/Lf where c, is the non-rotating phase speed, L is a length scale that characterizes the lake dimension, and f is the Coriolis parameter). For the cyclonic (rotating in the same direction as the earth's rotation), lowest radial mode (a Kelvin wave for small S(i) and a Poincare wave for large S(i)), the total potential to kinetic energy ratio was always greater than unity for all azimuthal modes. For all other radial modes (Poincare waves for all S(i)), both cyclonic and anticyclonic, the ratio is substantially less than unity, especially as the Burger number decreases. The results demonstrate that basin-scale Poincare waves follow the same rotation-gravity balance as unbounded plane progressive Poincare waves, in which rotation plays an increasingly important role as the Burger number decreases. The solutions are applied to field experiments conducted in Lake Kinneret (Israel) to determine the dissipation timescale of the basin-scale internal waves. It is further shown that features of the spatial structure of isopycnal displacement and velocity scales may be inferred from a single station that measures potential energy fluctuations.},

@article{ray_connectivities_2005,
	Abstract = {Connectivity is an important concept in landscape ecology, but has   several meanings. Here, I treat this term generically, including   interactions among land- and seascape elements, transfers of nutrients   among them, and interactions among closely related species comprising   guilds. Complex relationships between the natural histories of   estuary-dependent fishes are best understood in the context of the   "coastal realm", the heterogeneous and diverse portion of Earth where   land, sea, and atmosphere interact with great intensity through   exchanges of energy and materials. Especially for anadromous fishes,   estuaries form especially important conduits between terrestrial   watersheds and the coastal ocean. For this reason, these species may be   termed "estuary-dependent". However, for many species that use   estuaries, dependency may be difficult to define. I illustrate   coastal-realm connectivities for two groups of closely related estuarine   species from different latitudes: (1) clupeids of the {US} east coast, and   (2) salmonids of the Bering Sea. These groups inhabit coastal-ocean   waters as adults and use estuaries and/or freshwaters for reproduction   or as nursery areas. Both groups have evolved metapopulation structures,   perhaps also contingent patterns of behavior, that indicate hierarchical   interactions within metaestuarine or metafluvial systems. Their natural   histories suggest an estuary-dependent adaptive complex involving   opportunistic life histories and redundancies within species guilds,   which offer resiliency for these guilds under conditions of ecological   and/or environmental change. I conclude that: (1) estuarine   connectivities are best illustrated for fishes that can be shown to be   estuary dependent at some life-history stage; (2) resiliency for   functionally important guilds may also offer resiliency to their   ecosystems; and (3) further understanding connectivities among coastal   fishes and their changing environments depends on the fusion of natural   history with land-seascape ecology on multiple scales.

	Abstract = {The dynamics of the world's larger permanently open estuaries have been   well documented, but much less is known about the complex dynamics of   smaller temporarily open/closed estuaries ({TOCEs}). Seventy per cent of   South Africa's 250 estuaries are classified as {TOCEs}, and many are less   than 50 ha. A conceptual model of the water-quality dynamics of {TOCEs}   has been proposed, primarily considering three hydrodynamic states   (closed, semi-closed and open). This paper uses data from the East   Kleinemonde Estuary, a small {TOCE} in the warm-temperate region of South   Africa, to verify the model, focusing on physico-chemical parameters   (salinity, temperature, {pH}, dissolved oxygen and turbidity) and   inorganic macronutrients (dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved   inorganic phosphate) for the open and closed states. The results   generally fitted the model in terms of the behaviour of the   physico-chemical parameters and macronutrients in the water column. This   knowledge provides a first approach to predict the water-quality   dynamics in small {TOCEs}, thereby ensuring that the often limited   resources are targeted at resolving uncertainties at appropriate   temporal and spatial scales. {TOCEs} are not unique to South Africa and   also occur along other coasts (Mediterranean and south-western   Australia) where this type of model could also be applied.},

@article{hayhoe_emissions_2004,
	Abstract = {The magnitude of future climate change depends substantially on the greenhouse gas emission pathways we choose. Here we explore the implications of the highest and lowest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions pathways for climate change and associated impacts in California. Based on climate projections from two state-of-the-art climate models with low and medium sensitivity (Parallel Climate Model and Hadley Centre Climate Model, version 3, respectively), we find that annual temperature increases nearly double from the lower B1 to the higher A1fi emissions scenario before 2100. Three of four simulations also show greater increases in summer temperatures as compared with winter. Extreme heat and the associated impacts on a range of temperature-sensitive sectors are substantially greater under the higher emissions scenario, with some interscenario differences apparent before midcentury. By the end of the century under the B1 scenario, heatwaves and extreme heat in Los Angeles quadruple in frequency while heat-related mortality increases two to three times; alpine/subalpine forests are reduced by 50--75\%; and Sierra snowpack is reduced 30--70\%. Under A1fi, heatwaves in Los Angeles are six to eight times more frequent, with heat-related excess mortality increasing five to seven times; alpine/subalpine forests are reduced by 75--90\%; and snowpack declines 73--90\%, with cascading impacts on runoff and streamflow that, combined with projected modest declines in winter precipitation, could fundamentally disrupt California's water rights system. Although interscenario differences in climate impacts and costs of adaptation emerge mainly in the second half of the century, they are strongly dependent on emissions from preceding decades.},

@article{forbes_babbage_1981,
	Abstract = {Inputs, transfer processes, and storage characteristics of water and sediment have been investigated in a 40-km² estuarine system on the central Yukon coast. The setting is transgressive, microtidal, and high-latitude (69$\,^{\circ}$N). The Babbage Estuary system can be subdivided into fluvial, tidal-distributary, delta-plain, intertidal, lagoon,
marginal-supratidal, and barrier subsystems, each associated with one or more distinctive depositional environments and characteristic lithofacies assemblages. The structure of the system has been examined in terms of links between subsystems and overall system response to input perturbations. Although the propagation of tide and surge within the estuary may be treated as a quasi-linear stochastic process, transfers of fluvial water and sediment through the system are highly non-linear. Furthermore, the parameters of the system change dramatically on an annual cycle.
Inputs and associated system responses are dominated in the short run by seasonal- and synoptic-scale variance, the former reflecting major seasonal adjustments in the phase distribution, circulation process, iand input regime of the estuary. The annual salinity cycle, with a range of at least 60 ppt, exhibits a short reaction and long relaxation response to major snowmelt runoff inputs in May or June, when salt water

is flushed completely out of the estuary. Wind-generated waves are effectively absent from the system during 8-9 months of the year, but play a major role during the open-water season. Although direct transport of sediment by ice is relatively unimportant, ice effects are pervasive; they include, in addition to restriction of winter runoff and surface wave generation, creation of hypersaline conditions, control of the sedimentologically important flood events on deltaic supratidal flats, enhanced rates of coastal recession due to thermal degradation of ground ice, and production of distinctive thermokarst morphology on supratidal surfaces. Water level, storage volume, salinity, and suspended sediment series during the open-water season in the lagoon are dominated by synoptic-scale wind effects. In the delta, the major synoptic-scale anomalies of sediment concentration are related to storm runoff. Fluvial clastic sediment inputs to the estuary exceed 10⁸ kg A⁻¹ almost an order of magnitude greater than the estimated littoral transport input. More than 97\% of the fluvial input may occur in June; of this, approximately half may be exported directly from the system.
At long time scales, the estuarine system has been dominated by rising sea level and coastal recession; Holocene climatic fluctuations may also have been important. A transgressive sequence has developed, including various distinctive features, notably the absence or limited development of aeolian, backbarrier-margin, tidal-delta, and intertidal marsh facies, a largely afaunal intertidal

component, and deltaic deposits with poorly developed levees and abundant lake basins. The basal fluvial component includes a sinuous gravel channel assemblage of a hitherto poorly documented type. The Babbage Estuary barrier sequence is primarily transgressive, but incorporates localized elements of progradational and inlet-migration models. Examples of major transgressive, progradational, and inlet-fill barrier sequences occur in close proximity on the central Yukon coast.},

@article{caldwell_empirical_2007,
	Abstract = {Surf forecasts are vital for safety, property protection, and planning of coastal activities. In Hawaii, surf is frequently dangerous during the boreal fall through spring for northwest- through north-facing coastal areas, which are characterized by narrow shelves, steep bottom slopes, and zones of high refraction. Forecasts of deepwater wave characteristics have improved with the advancement of the Wave Watch {III} model. A waverider buoy located 5 km northwest of Waimea Bay, Oahu measures the deepwater wave field. Although the offshore wave field is well forecasted and observed, the transformation to surf heights has not been clearly defined and verified. This paper describes an empirical method for estimating breaker heights derived from a comparison of Waimea buoy measurements and north shore, Oahu daily surf observations, which nominally represent the {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$H\_\{1/10\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} for the locations with the highest reported surf and have been recorded in Hawaii scale. The first task of this study is to translate the visual surf observations from Hawaii scale to trough-to-crest heights. The results show that the trough-to-crest heights are twice the Hawaii scale values within the 10-20\% margin of error for the full range of breaker sizes encountered in Hawaii. The empirical method is resolved by deriving a coefficient of refraction on the basis of comparisons of the trough-to-crest surf observations with the shoaling-only, estimated breaker heights, which are calculated from the Waimea buoy's significant wave heights and dominant periods. The resultant formula uses offshore wave height and period to estimate surf heights, which represent the {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$H\_\{1/10\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} for zones of high refraction, i.e., nominally the areas of highest surf. The empirical formula should be applicable to other coastal zones of the world with similar geophysical traits and could serve as a scale reference for coastal wave models, such as the Simulating Waves Nearshore model.},

It is concluded that ecological time, spatial heterogeneity, length of growing season, and amount of warm season productivity are all factors which determine the total number of lizard species occurring on an area, but that the most important single factor is the spatial heterogeneity (mainly vegetative) of the environment. It is suggested that climatic variability allows the coexistence of many different plant life forms, the variety of which in turn controls the number of lizard species.},

@article{van_katwijk_sediment_2010,
	Abstract = {Seagrasses are well-known ecosystem engineers. They reduce water dynamics and sediment resuspension, and trap fine sediments. However, exceptions of this paradigm have been reported. To test whether these exceptions could be related to plant cover and environmental conditions, we investigated sediment modification under influence of seagrass presence in various annual eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds with varying plant cover and sediment composition.

At the relatively wave-exposed, sandy sites, dense vegetation caused muddification (increase in fine sediments and organic content) of the sediments. Sparse vegetation (\&lt;35\% cover) had no effect, as such confirming the classical sediment trapping paradigm. In contrast, at the sheltered sites with muddy sediments, dense vegetation had no effect on the sediment composition, and in sparse vegetation sandification (decrease in fine sediments and organic content) was recorded. Sandification was never recorded before and was probably related to turbulence enhancement.

Both, muddification and sandification are likely to provide a feedback on seagrass performance. Muddification may increase the nutrient input and, depending on the nutrient status of the system, either stimulate or reduce seagrass development. Similarly, sandification may postpone and even prevent extinction of seagrass beds when it occurs in areas that may have become too muddy for seagrass growth.},

	Abstract = {Stream habitat complexity is correlated with fish species diversity in selected Indiana and Panama streams. Habitat diversity was measured along 3 dimensions judged important to a wide range of fish groups and applicable to many stream conditions: stream depth, bottom type, and current. Increasing community and habitat diversity followed stream-order gradients. Natural streams supported fish communities of high species diversity which were seasonally more stable than the lower-diversity communities of modified streams. After disturbances such as channelization, seasonal peaks in species diversity attain levels typical of undisturbed streams. Because seasonal changes in stream quality are high, the stability of the fish community is lower in modified than in natural streams. The general correlation between habitat characteristics and presence and absence of fish species suggests that most fishes of small streams are habitat specialists.},

A formula for the drag force on the vegetation was included as a sink term in the Navier-Stokes equations. The advantage with this method compared with using large roughness is that effects of the vegetation over the whole water depth can be taken into account, instead of only affecting the velocity near the bed. The numerical model was tested against three laboratory experiments from straight flumes with uniform flow, where vegetation partially covered the cross-section. The velocity and vegetation density varied in both vertical and horizontal directions in the different cases. The experiments also included varying crosssectional shapes. All tests gave fairly good correspondence between computed and measured velocity profiles.},

@article{adams_southern_2008,
	Abstract = {We consider the effect of decadal climate change on the historic wave climate of the Southern California Bight ({SCB}) using a 50 year hindcast record (1948-98) for waves generated in the North Pacific winter. Deep-water wave height, period, and direction are examined with respect to the Southern Oscillation Index ({SOI}) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ({PDO}). Storms occurring during strong La Nina intervals, when the {SOI} is greater than 1.0, concurrent with either a cool or warm phase of the {PDO}, are indistinguishable in wave character. In marked contrast, wave conditions arising from storms during strong El Nino intervals, when the {SOI} is less than - 1.0, concurrent with the {PDO} cool phase (1948-77), differ greatly from wave conditions of storms during strong El Nino intervals concurrent with the {PDO} warm phase (1978-98). Our statistical analyses characterize the deep-water winter wave climate as consistent during La Nina intervals (mean values H(s) = 3.3 m, T(s) = 13.0 s, alpha = 293 degrees, for the highest 5\% of waves), but variable during El Nino, intervals depending on {PDO} phase (H(s) = 3.64 m, T(s) = 13.8 s, alpha = 292 degrees during the {PDO} cool phase, and H(s) = 4.82 m, T(s) = 15.1 s, alpha - 284 degrees during the {PDO} warm phase, for the highest 5\% of waves). The dominant characteristics for the different operational modes of wave climate determined in this study provide realistic inputs for numerical models aimed at understanding past and. future coastal change within the {SCB}. Simulating {WAves} Nearshore ({SWAN})-modeled wave transformations for the southern portion of the Oceanside littoral cell show that nearshore wave heights during westerly wave conditions are roughly twice those of northwesterly wave conditions for the same deep-water wave heights and periods, indicating increasing wave energy flux at the beach during the westerly storm-source conditions by an average of 320\% (74 {kW}/m us. 23 {kW}/m).},
