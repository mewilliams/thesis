\section{Introduction}
Salt transport in small, intermittently closed estuaries... \emph{tends to be frontal, sharp gradients - both in vertical and in horizontal}

Salt moves in and out of the Pescadero estuary as described in chapter~\ref{ch3}. The water column remains stratified, and a mixed water column only exists when high freshwater flows have forced all salt from the confines of the estuary. But, with tidal velocities and infragravity oscillations acting on the stratified salt field, there must be some mixing and it behooves us to try to quantify mixing and its effects. \emph{why?}

\emph{Dispersion processes... turbulent mixing, shear dispersion, ... scale processes? --> why looking at K$_x$ instead of $K_z$}

\emph{Background on what I'm trying to do.  Cite Ralston \& Stacey 2005- Longitudinal dispersion... tidal straining (Simpson et al, 1990, Burchard \& Baumert 1998?),.. longitudinal dispersion (Okubu, 1973; Lissa's thesis paper?)}, here I will cite \parencite{Ralston:2005aa} and maybe also John Simpson's paper \parencite{Simpson:1990aa}. 


\subsubsection{What papers are relevant here? Quickly describe them:}
\parencite{okubo_effect_1973}: Shoreline irregualarities trap tracers, and this acts as a mechanism for dispersion of said tracers.  In a marsh this might function as water being trapped in the vegetation or sloughs and small channels. Because water here is slower moving, tracer will disperse back out... causing \emph{dispersion}. \emph{This analysis is based on multiple tidal cycles/subtidal flow, and thus the applicabiltiy of Okobu's analysis may be limited systems where subtidal flow doesn't really mean anything \parencite{Ralston:2005aa}}.

\section{Methods} \label{sec:ch4methods}

%% 1D Advection-diffusion
\subsection{1D advection-diffusion} \label{ssec:1dadvdif}

\emph{This form assumes K$_x \ne f(x)$. Big problem?}

We start with the depth-averaged 1-d advection-diffusion of salinity,
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} + U\frac{\partial S}{\partial x} = K_x\frac{\partial^2S}{\partial x^2} \label{eq:1dadvdiff}
\end{eqnarray}
where \emph{S} is salinity, \emph{U} is depth-averaged velocity, and \emph{K$_x$} is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient \emph{(or mixing term..)}. In an estuary, the salt structure is advected upstream and downstream with the tides. Moving the frame of reference along with these tides, \emph{U=0} relative to the reference frame and equation~\ref{eq:1dadvdiff} becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = K_x\frac{\partial^2S}{\partial x^2} \label{eq:1ddiff}
\end{eqnarray}
. An analytical solution to equation~\ref{eq:1ddiff} can be obtained using the following boundary and initial conditions: \emph{(Spell out?)}
\begin{eqnarray}
S(x,t=0) = step function\label{eq:1ddiffIC}\\
S(x=\infty,t) = S_0\label{eq:1ddiffBC1}\\
S(x=-\infty,t) = 0\label{eq:1ddiffBC2}\\
\end{eqnarray}
where \emph{S$_0$} is the \emph{ocean salinity and/or upper end of step function}. \emph{Using these initial and boundary conditions, you get to:}
\begin{eqnarray}
S(x,t) = \frac{S_0}{2}\left(1+erf\left(\frac{x-x_c}{\sqrt{4K_xt}}\right)\right) \label{eq:S}
\end{eqnarray}
where \emph{x$_c$} is the center of the salt front. 


%%% Observations --> Analytical framework
\subsection{Getting observations into the analytical framework} \label{ssec:ObsInto1DAdvDiff}


With point measurements obtained in the Pescadero estuary, values for \emph{K$_x$} can be obtained: 

Focusing on velocity and salinity measurements made during the April - June 2012 field deployment (described in detail in the previous chapter).... An ADV collected point velocity measurements colocated with a CTD measuring \emph{X} cm above the bed \emph{(20cm? 30 cm?)}. Longitudinal salinity gradients in the Pescadero estuary as well as in other small bar-built estuaries are very sharp, so \emph{locating instruments close enough to each other to directly measure the longitudinal gradient and getting spatial coverage to understand dyanamics of a whole system is difficult...}, so we recreate the salinity structure in time by assuming pure advection past the sensor. 

\begin{eqnarray}
U = \frac{dx}{dt} \label{eq:uEdxdt}\\
\int{Udt} = \int{dx} = X \label{eq:intuEx}
\end{eqnarray}
By taking the integral of the ADV velocity, equation~\ref{eq:intuEx} allows us to transform the time series of velocity ($U(x_{NM},t)$) and salinity ($S(x_{NM},t)$) measurements (Figure~\ref{fig:UandSvsT}) into a spatial representation of salinity ($S(x)$, Figure~\ref{fig:SvsXall}).

%%%% Data Processing Specifics
\subsection{Data processing specifics} \label{ssec:DataProcessing}
To make this dataset, velocity measurements were burst-averaged (\emph{8.3 min. burst?... specifics in previous chapter}) and an 800 sec moving average was applied to the CTD measurements.  Averaging was intended to remove the infragravity oscillation component of velocity and salinity measurements to focus on tidal processes. 

To get \emph{K$_x$} from the recreated \emph{S(x)}, equation~\ref{eq:S} was rearranged into the linear form:
\begin{eqnarray}
erf^{-1}\left(\frac{2S}{S_0}-1\right) = \frac{x-x_c}{\sqrt{4K_xt}} \label{eq:linfitS}
\end{eqnarray}
and a linear fit ((y = ax + b).. a = $\frac{1}{\sqrt{4K_xt}}$ and b = $\frac{-x_c}{\sqrt{4K_xt}}$) is applied. Given a linear regression fit value for \emph{a}, to solve for $K_x$, a value of \emph{t} must be determined. In this case it is appropriate to use the time between when the front floods past the sensors and subsequent ebb of said front. This method assumes an infinitely sharp front at time $t_0$. Setting $t_0$ as the time at which the front floods past the sensors will overestimate \emph{K$_x$}. Thus, an estimation on the initial time from a sharp front to the flood front is made. By setting a step function at the mouth, and approximating advection velocities U = 0.1 m s$^{-1}$ and a length from the ocean to NM of 100 m, initial time, t$_0$ is 1000 s. This time is then added to the time between a selected isopycnal passing by the sensor. Specific considerations in selecting the isopycnal to follow, and implications will be discussed \emph{later (in sec. X)}. 



\section{Observations} \label{sec:ObsCh4}
Time series of collocated velocity and salinity measurements at NM are shown in figure~\ref{fig:UandSvsTch4}. Gaps in measured data occur when the water level is very low and sensors were out of the water. In response to coastal California's mixed semidiurnal tide, the time series shows that salt water does not remain in the system on the low high tide as long as it does on the high high tide. Here we focus only on the tidal cycle associated with high high water level. 

The time series plots of salinity and velocity (Figure~\ref{fig:UandSvsTch4}b) show that the transition from fresh to saline water occurs rapidly on the flood and the return to fresh water on ebb is a longer duration process. On ebb, lower salinities demonstrate a much more relaxed salinity structure than higher salinities. The flood salinities do not exhibit this feature. To investigate whether this observation is an actual transition in salinity and not just a reduction in water velocity, as well as to approach a quantification of \emph{K$_x$}, the time series is transformed into a spatial record as described in section~\ref{sec:ch4methods}. 

Figure~\ref{fig:SvsXall} shows the salt front on flood (a) and on ebb (b) for the four large tides on 21 - 25 April, 2012. Spatial mapping of the salinity field shows that the estuary transforms  the salinity front from a smooth, sharp structure on flood to a two-part relaxed structure on ebb, where the lower salinity's structure is much more relaxed than the higher salinity structure. This non uniform structure suggests that calculating two different values of \emph{K$_x$} for the higher and lower salinities is necessary.

Values of \emph{K$_x$} are calculated for the upper and lower salinities in the four tidal cycles using this data (Figures~\ref{fig:Kx421}-~\ref{fig:Kx424}). Values of \emph{t} for \emph{K$_x$} calculations are taken to be the time between when the 10 PSU and 20 PSU isopycnals flood and ebb past the sensor for lower and higher salinity \emph{K$_x$} values, respectively. Values of \emph{K$_x$} show that dispersion is much greater at lower salinities than at higher salinities in the Pescadero estuary. Results are tabuled in table ~\ref{tab:Kxtable}. Values of \emph{K$_x$} are an order of magnitude higher in lower salinities than in higher salinities. Dispersion coefficients in lower salinity water (\emph{K$_{x,S=0 \rightarrow S_T}$}), where \emph{S$_T$} is the salinity of the transition in structure, are higher in the first two days than in the last two. Dispersion coefficients in higher salinity water (\emph{K$_{x,S=S_T \rightarrow S_0}$}) are lower in the first two days than in the second two days. 

Comparison to theory, hypothesized mechanisms of dispersion, reasons for the two-phase structure of \emph{S(x)}, and changes with physical forcing are discussed below. 

\section{Comparison to theoretical ways to estimate $K_x$}

Dispersion caused by vertical shear \emph{(in an unstratified water column?)} was empircally found by Elder to be
\begin{eqnarray}
K_x = 5.93hu_* \label{eq:Kshear}
\end{eqnarray}
where \emph{h} is the height of the water column and \emph{u$_*$} is the shear velocity defined by $u_*=\sqrt{\tau_0/\rho}$ where $\tau$ is a bed stress and $\rho$ is water density \emph{NEED ELDER REF.. or as found in Fischer}. The friction velocity is parameterized as $u_* = c_{_D}^{1/2}U$. In the Pescadero estuary, \emph{h} ranges from 0.2 m to 2.7 m depending on location in the estuary and tidal conditions, \emph{U} is $\pm$ 0.4 m s\textsuperscript{-1} due to tides, and surges due to infragravity motions may result in positive velocities of 0.6 m s\textsuperscript{-1}. Estimating c$_D$ as 0.01, the largest \emph{K$_x$} by this formulation would be \emph{K$_x = 0.96 m^2 s^{-1}$} using the maximum value of \emph{h} and the infragravity velocity of $U = 0.6 m s^{-1}$. More likely values of $h = 1 m$ and $U = 0.3 m s^{-1}$ result an estimated \emph{K$_x = 0.18 m^2 s^{-1}$}. In either case, the empirical value of \emph{K$_x$} is well below observations.

\emph{longitudinal dispersion via tidal trapping...}
\begin{eqnarray}
K = \frac{K^{'}}{1+r} + \frac{ru_0^2}{2k(1+r)^2(1+r+\omega / k)} \label{eq:KxOkubo}
\end{eqnarray}

\emph{quoted from Fischer:} "where K$^{'}$ is the longitudinal diffusivity in the main channel itself. uniform velocity of flow in the main channel of velocity $u = u_0 \cos(\omega t)$ and a uniform distribution of traps along the sides having a ratio of trap volume to to channel volume of r and a characteristic exhange time between traps and main flow of k$^{-1}$, effective long. diffusivity is.." equation above. \emph{discussion here...}


\section{Why these values of $K_x$?}

The method of \emph{making $\int{U}dt = X$} allows the observation of the spatial structure of the salinity field.  As the method is reliant on the salinity field advecting past the sensors, it lacks the ability to inform where mixing is occuring, whether it is a continuous process or controlled by a bathymetric feature elsewhere in the estuary. 

\subsection{Why this two-part structure?}

This approach aims to simplify the estuarine salt dynamics in the Pescadero estuary into a one-dimensional framework. The different mixing characteristics at lower and higher salinities reflect effects of vertical structure on the.. \emph{salt field}. 

To understand the vastly different values of \emph{K$_x$} in higher and lower salities, we look to time series of salinities at different depths in the estuary. Figure~\ref{fig:SDCApr2012} shows data from three CTDs vertically distributed in the water column at the upstream DC station, approximately \emph{how many?} m upstream from the NM station. The first subplot (a) shows the depth of each sensor. The bed sensor was fixed 20 cm above the bed and the surface sensor was floating on a buoy approximatly 20 cm below the surface. The middle sensor was hanging from a buoy such that at most times its line was slack, but at high enough water levels the line went taught and the sensor was pulled further underwater. The second subplot (b) gives salinity at these sensors. The mid-column sensor in (b) shows a similar structure to the CTD colocated with the ADV at NM (Figure~\ref{fig:UandSvsTch4}).

The surface salinity at DC on the diurnal high high tide has two peaks (Figure ~\ref{fig:SDCApr2012}b, \emph{color} line). The first peak is attributed to advection of the salt field upstream with the flood tide, and the fast drop \emph{should be} the movement of saline surface waters back downstream with the coupled effect of \emph{ebbing tide} and buoyancy-driven restratification of the flow. A second peak in surface salinity occurs as the high salinity at depth begins to lower. This peak represents water that had been trapped upstream moving past the lower estuary sensors. 

The structure seen in the mid-column at DC or at the NM collocated ADV and CTD is thus evidence of mixing in the upper water colum between this second pulse more saline surface waters and salinities at upper and middle depth. 

\subsection{Where does it come from?}

Several mechanisms may allow the trapping and release of water that induces a second phase of salinity mixing... Sensors are located primarily in the lower estuary, and no surface sensor measurements were made upstream of DC, so these hypotheses are not readily testible. At least three features of the Pescadero estuary could contribute to the bimodal surface salinity spike seen in conjunction with the high high tide:

\subsubsection{Confluence of two creeks}
Approximately \emph{1000 m} upstream from the mouth of the Pescadero estuary, two creeks form a confluence (Figure~\ref{fig:geMarsh}). Salt water carried by the flood tide may move up the Pescadero Creek or up the Butano Creek. In a third process described below, it may also move through culverts into a channel to the shallow North Pond. \emph{description of tidal trapping here}.. Phasing of tidal flow into these channels may cause interactions which set up a delayed pulse of salt water downstream. 

Bed sensors in each creek approximately the same distance from the confluence \emph{(check this)} (Figure~\ref{fig:PCBC421:425}) show that less salt water moves up the Pescadero Creek than the Butano Creek. This could be due to higher freshwater flow from the Pescadero Creek, which may allow for \emph{... hydraulic control at the channel that would push Pescadero water into Butano, or... (think about this some more)} 

\subsubsection{Marsh}
The Pescadero Creek flows into the lower estuary through a relatively constricted, channelized creek bed.  Meanwhile, the Butano Creek flow through an extensive salt marsh. This marsh floods significantly with a closed mouth (cf Chapter~\ref{ch2}), but as is the nature of salt marshes, some flooding occurs tidally. \emph{words on dispersion and vegetation. or maybe this also counts as tidal trapping... because of sloughs and shallow old butano creekbed}. 

Bed salinity measurements in the Pescadero and Butano Creeks suggest that within the Pescadero Creek (upstream of the confluence of both the Butano and the culverts to the North Pond) do not demonstrate the same structure seen downstream of these controls. The time series of salinity is very sharp and mostly uniform on flood and ebb (Figures~\ref{fig:PCBC421:425} and~\ref{fig:PCBC511:516}). Bed salinity measurements in the Butano Creek show a slightly more relaxed flood salinity structure, and show signs of a two-phase ebb salinity structure. The later time series (Figure~\ref{fig:PCBC511:516}) actually shows two pulses of saline water on the ebb, similar to surface measurements downstream.  The instruments were fixed closer to the bed than the colocated ADV and CTD, so these measurements may not directly translate... but do suggest something is going on in the salt marshes.  

Within the Butano Creek marshes, various sloughs exist, and the historic creek bed has undergone massive sedimentation so that the main channel is now \emph{different}. Satellite photos show this shallow bed (Figure~\ref{fig:geMarsh}), and this could certainly be a trap of slow moving water... \emph{high friction there because shallow...}. 

\subsubsection{Culverts and flow to North Pond}
The North Pond in the Pescadero marsh is connected to the Pescadero creek through a channel and dilapidated culverts (Figures~\ref{fig:geNP} and~\ref{fig:photoCulverts}). \emph{The culverts through a levee were designed to be able to regulate flow to the North Pond via gates, but the gates have rusted and culverts remain perennially open.} The highly constricted flow... 

In any of these mechanisms, lower salinity water is subject to \emph{these effects} because density effects mean higher salinity water does not access the shallow marsh or culverted environments... 

\subsection{Variation in two-phase K$_x$ structure}
Figure~\ref{fig:SsurfLT} shows surface salinity at DC. Early in the time series, the \emph{estuary is in a} spring tide, neap tides are from \emph{these dates} and then the spring tide...\emph{eh, probably should put a depth record on this one}. Lower values of \emph{S$_T$} on 21 and 22 April correspond with second pulses of salt water with lower salinity as shown by the green line in figure~\ref{fig:DC_salt_421_425}c. Higher values on 23 and 24 April correspond with pulses of salt water of higher salinity. The longer term figure shows that this second pulse of salt water follows the spring tides and shuts down during the neap tide. \emph{previous stuff makes sense} because as the water level gets higher during the spring, higher salinity water will have access to shallower \emph{regions}, trapping higher salinity water... 

Differences between the salinity magnitude of the first and second spring tides is attributed to two factors: the first is that the second spring tide had higher water levels than the first spring tide (\emph{figure from ch 3?}), and the second is that lower freshwater discharge was present during the second spring. 

\section{Assumptions \& sensitivity to these assumptions (limitations)}

Figure~\ref{fig:tvsS} ~\ref{fig:Kxvst}

\emph{I used the value of t at 20 PSU for higher salinities and 10 PSU for lower salinities.  Figure ~\ref{fig:tvsS} shows that the time... isn't constant across these salinities.. will introduce error}.  Next figure ~\ref{fig:Kxvst} gives some approximate ranges of K$_x$ using different isopycnals as representative of the two salinity regimes \emph{(higher S: 18 - 25, lower S: 5 - 10)} and thus different times...
