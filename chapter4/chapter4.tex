\section{Introduction}
Salt transport in small, intermittently closed estuaries... \emph{tends to be frontal, sharp gradients - both in vertical and in horizontal}

Salt moves in and out of the Pescadero estuary as described in chapter~\ref{ch3}. The water column remains stratified, and a mixed water column only exists when high freshwater flows have forced all salt from the confines of the estuary. But, with tidal velocities and infragravity oscillations acting on the stratified salt field, there must be some mixing and it behooves us to try to quantify mixing and its effects. \emph{why?}



\emph{Background on what I'm trying to do.  Cite Ralston \& Stacey 2005- Longitudinal dispersion... tidal straining (Simpson et al, 1990, Burchard \& Baumert 1998?),.. longitudinal dispersion (Okubu, 1973; Lissa's thesis paper?)}, here I will cite \parencite{Ralston:2005aa} and maybe also John Simpson's paper \parencite{Simpson:1990aa}. 

\emph{salt is conservative, implications for temperature, plankton, other stuff that advects and diffuses around...}



\section{Methods}

Depth-averaged 1-d advection-diffusion of salinity:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dS}{dt} + U\frac{dS}{dx} = K_x\frac{d^2S}{dx^2} \label{eq:1dadvdiff}
\end{eqnarray}
...
\begin{eqnarray}
S(x,t) = \frac{S_o}{2}(1+erf(\frac{x-x_c}{\sqrt{4K_xt}})) \label{eq:S}
\end{eqnarray}

Focusing on velocity and salinity measurements made during the April - June 2012 field deployment (described in detail in the previous chapter).... An ADV collected point velocity measurements colocated with a CTD measuring 20 cm above the bed \emph{(confirm)}. Longitudinal salinity gradients in the Pescadero estuary as well as in other small bar-built estuaries are very sharp, so \emph{locating instruments close enough to each other to directly measure the longitudinal gradient and getting spatial coverage to understand dyanamics of a whole system is difficult...}, so we rely on an \emph{approach based on...}


\begin{itemize} \item{velocity and salt measurements averaged on X window} \item{then fake x made} \end{itemize}

\begin{eqnarray}
u = \frac{dx}{dt} \label{eq:uEdxdt}\\
\int{<u>dt} = \int{dx} = x \label{eq:intuEx}
\end{eqnarray}
So, by taking the integral of the ADV velocity, equation~\ref{eq:intuEx} allows us to transform a point velocity and salinity measurement into an approximation of \emph{X or Length or...}. 




\section{Observations}
\emph{Start with time series of U and S, go from there to 1-d approximation}

\emph{Insert figure: U and S from colocated ADV, CTD vs. time}



\section{Quantifying $K_x$}
\emph{use ds/dx to quantify kx, discusses nick points.}
\section{Things to discuss}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Does this extend across all tides (I'm thinking spring-neap cycle)
	\item Does this extend across seasons (with open mouth state)?
	\item Dependent on freshwater... \emph{not sure what my thoughts are here, but it's in a sribbled note}
	\item \emph{Vertical... figure last}
\end{itemize}



\emph{spring-neap:
more salt pushed up estuary, interactin with bathymetry happesn at higher salinities, nick point occurs at 15 instead of 10. somewhere up estaury, change in salinity field that is advected back past us. }

\subsection{quick description of getting K$_x$ values}
The salt structure advecting in is almost a step function, but not quite. By setting a step function at the mouth, and approximating advection velocities U = 0.1 m s$^{-1}$ and a lenght from the ocean to NM of 100 m, initial time, t$_o$ is 1000 s. This initial time was then added to the time between the 15 PSU isopycnal passing by the CTD so that the time used to in the best fit of \emph{error function part} is t = t$_o$ + t$_{time between 15 PSU measurements}$... 

\emph{real steps to get K$_x$:} get time between S = 15 PSU passing NM sensors.  estimate ~ 17 min from step function to flood S(x),... make equation~\ref{eq:S} 
\begin{eqnarray}
erf^{-1}(\frac{2S}{S_o}-1) = \frac{x-x_c}{\sqrt{4K_xt}} \label{eq:linfitS}
\end{eqnarray}
which can be linearly fit (y = ax + b).. a = $\frac{1}{\sqrt{4K_xt}}$ and b = $\frac{-x_c}{\sqrt{4K_xt}}$, and then using a value of t obtained by the time when the 15 PSU isohaline passed the sensors, K$_x$ was obtained.  \emph{take home message: K$_x$ is an order of magnitude higher in lower salinities than higher salinities. }

could be more scientifically sound:
\begin{itemize}
	\item S$_{transition}$ was eyeballed. Should be done with a more rigorous method. 
	\item t was eyeballed.
	\item S$_o$ is 32 to 33.5 depending on code crashing... 
\end{itemize}

\emph{I could imagine adjusting t based on some mid low/high salinity (10 and 20)}
