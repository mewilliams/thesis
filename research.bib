	Abstract = {Intermittently closed and open lakes and lagoons ({ICOLLs}) are shallow barrier lakes which are intermittently connected to the sea and experience saline intrusions. Many {ICOLLs} are mechanically opened to prevent flooding of surrounding agricultural and urban land and to flush water of poor quality. In this study, the effects of modified opening regimes (frequency and duration of barrier openings and closures) on water quality and phytoplankton in two New Zealand {ICOLLs} were investigated over a number of opening/closure cycles. Water quality in Lake Ellesmere (Te Waihora) responded weakly to both opening and closing events, indicating that sea--{ICOLL} exchange did not markedly improve water quality. Conversely, water quality in Waituna Lagoon responded rapidly to barrier openings; water level decreased to near sea level within days of opening and subsequent seawater exchange resulted in rapid decreases in nitrate and chlorophyll a concentrations. The closure of Waituna Lagoon resulted in rapid rise in water level and a pulse of nitrate and phosphorus in the water column and phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentrations increased with increasing closed-period duration. Based on data on the underwater light climate and nutrient dynamics, phytoplankton in Lake Ellesmere was probably light-limited, whereas phytoplankton in Waituna Lagoon was rarely light-limited, and appeared to be predominately P-limited. The marked differences in responses of Lake Ellesmere and Waituna Lagoon to barrier openings and closures reflected differences in {ICOLL} water levels and morphological characteristics, which dictated the degree of tidal flushing when the barriers were open. The inter-{ICOLL} differences observed in this study indicate that unless the effects of {ICOLL} openings/closures on phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics are understood, changes to {ICOLL} opening regimes may have unintended consequences for the water quality and ecology of these systems.},

@article{Burchard:1998aa,
	Abstract = {Abstract By means of a numerical model of an idealized flat-bottom estuary, the paper studies the hydrodynamic control of the turbidity zone by the combined effect of the salt wedge and tidal movements. The model is of two- dimensional (x, z) finite-difference type with high resolution in time and space. It computes momentum, surface elevation, salinity, suspended particulate matter ({SPM}), turbulent kinetic energy, and dissipation rate as prognostic state variables. At the seaward boundary a tidal forcing is applied. At the landward boundary a weir is situated where a constant freshwater discharge is prescribed. The initial {SPM} concentration is horizontally homogeneous. After simulating a few tidal periods the model results exhibit the evolution of a stable {SPM} peak (the estuarine turbidity maximum or {ETM}) at the tip of the salt wedge. An inspection of the tidal mean velocity profiles around the {ETM} shows that this trapping of {SPM} is due to a residual near-bottom upstream current in the region of the salt wedge. Three physical causes for this residual countercurrent are investigated in greater detail by numerical experiments, namely, (i) the residual gravitational circulation, (ii) the tidal velocity asymmetry, and (iii) the tidal mixing asymmetry. The first mechanism is related to the baroclinic part of the longitudinal pressure gradient. The second and third mechanism are based on the differences between the vertical profiles of velocity and {SPM}, respectively, at flood and ebb tide. For the macrotidal estuary considered here, the consideration of both (i) and (ii) could be shown to be necessary for the establishment of an {ETM} in the considered idealized estuary. It could further be shown that (iii) affects the {ETM} formation only quantitatively but not qualitatively and appears to be not necessary for the existence of an {ETM}.},

@article{Okubo:1973aa,
	Abstract = {Irregularities in the shoreline of an embayment act as a trap for water properties such as an introduced pollutant. The exchange of water between the trap and the main body may lead to an effective longitudinal dispersion of these properties. A mathematical model for this problem is developed, in which the exchange process between the trap and main body can be parameterized by the geometry of the system as well as by an exchange rate coefficient. In effect, the trap system behaves as a localized source-and-sink of substance for the main body of water.

The model enables us to discuss the moments of the substance distribution. It is shown that, depending upon the values of parameters chosen, the presence of a trap may enhance or suppress the rate of dispersion in the main stream. This study suggests that the entrapment phenomenon may be a process of practical importance in longitudinal dispersion of substance in estuaries and coastal waters.},

@article{Ralston:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Field observations indicate that a tidal salinity front that is regenerated each lower low water is a prominent feature of intertidal zone flow during wet winter months. A strong longitudinal density gradient at the front influences flow dynamics through tidal straining and baroclinic forcing. During each inundation period the salinity gradient disperses as it advects across the intertidal zone. The average longitudinal dispersivity estimated from observations is about 10 m2 sâˆ’1. A three-dimensional numerical model yields comparable estimates of tidally averaged dispersivity for an idealized bathymetry with a subtidal channel and intertidal shoals. The instantaneous dispersivity through the tidal cycle depends on both vertical and lateral shear in along-channel velocity. Dispersion due to vertical shear is greatest during stratified ebbs and inversely depends on tidal forcing; dispersion due to lateral shear results from bathymetric variability between channel and shoal and increases with tidal amplitude. Similarly, the along-channel residual velocity is a combination of baroclinic and frictional processes. Frictional effects dominate the depth-averaged residual such that net flow is upstream on the shoals and downstream in the channel; however, the frictional pattern is moderated by baroclinic forcing at the front. Although along-channel dynamics dominate, differential advection of the salinity front establishes lateral baroclinic circulation between channel and shoals. Lateral residual circulation is flood dominant with dense water moving out of channel near the bed and convergence from the shoals at the surface. At times near the front the lateral salt flux can significantly affect the salinity budget in the channel.},
